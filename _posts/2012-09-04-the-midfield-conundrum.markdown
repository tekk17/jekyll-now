We Red Devils really really love to make one big rant about our incapable midfield everytime we loose a game. I for one do it quite regualrly and not a single transfer window has passed since 2010 that i have not secretly wished that we signed a capable central midfielder. But Fergie somehow does not see like it and thus after 2007 signing of Anderson, it was only this summer, after 5 very long years did we sign a central midfielder albeit a creative one in Nick Powell from Crewe Alexandria.

What make it so difficult to sign a CM for our squad. Fergie berates about the lack of quality in the transfer market. He did try signing Wesley Sneijder from Inter last summer and had it not been for his wage demands he could well have made the move and salvage a what has now been a pretty big downward spiral in otherwise glorious career. I have read quite a few posts on the type of midfielders that United really need and kind of players Fergie likes playing in the centre of the park for us. Jonathan Wilson had made an intersting point sometime last year when he noted that Fergie like to have one sitter and another runner in midfield. United have been developing likewise prototypes for these kind of roles. We have a Cleverley, Anderson and Fletcher who can run with the ball. Similarly we have a Carrick/Scholes[old age version ofcourse!] who like to sit deep and make some occassionally forays in the final third of the pitch.

Scholes was the most complete midfielder United have ever had and Fergie had to let go of his tried and trusted 4-4-2 principle in order to make the team tick with Scholes in it and Scholes had to alter his game to a huge extent to make sure he fit into his manager's plans of a 4-4-2. It was only in the later part of the decade with the continental flavour of Old Trafford growing and Carlos Queiroz's influence did Fergie show some flexibilty and develop hybrids to his 4-4-2 with a 4-4-1-1 and the very famous Ronaldo led 4-3-3-0 formation that won United the Champions League in 2008.

The midfield play has also evolved to a huge extent nowadays, I keep saying that we badly need a tough tackling box-box midfielder in the side who could grab games by the scruff of its neck and make things work for the creative players. Manager saw that need and duly signed Owen Hargreaves in 2007. And had it not been for his injuries, he would gone on to become a legend for us and make that no.4 shirt his own for a very long time. But it was not to be, Sir Alex has moulded a central midfielder out of Ryan Giggs, the biggest change that the manager made for the transition to make it easier has been the way we win the ball back in midifled. We rarely rely on tackling in the centre of park nowadays especially when Scholes/Giggs are playing. Vigorous Pressing starting from the fron two followed by good positioning through anticipation have made for some excellent interception work in the centre of the park and United do come off pretty good against most of the teams. But the problem begins when we face a team that has some excellent runners in the side, A physical force of nature like a Yaya Toure[or a Cheik Tiote/Fellaini, take your pick] or an excellent dribbler of the ball in Iniesta[Silva], then it becomes very difficult to cope for us as we cannot afford to sit too deep either since we lack the tacklers in the midfiled[apart from Carrick] to make it easy for the back 4.

Every system has its own problems and advantages, we surely are now more continental in our playing style and thus have been much better in Europe with an efficient midfield. With Tom Cleverley coming through the ranks, Ryan Tunnicliffe hopefully getting a chance this season and of course our warrior Darren Fletcher expected to make his long awaited return there are causes for optimism this season. And as far as the lack of signings in midfiled are concerned, I will pacify myself by saying that Fergie knows best.

Till next time................................................
