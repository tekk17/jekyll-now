Sacked! Roberto Di Matteo got fired yesterday morning by Chelsea and since then there has been an outrage in the media over his ousting. There has been all kind of columns, opinions written in the English press on how badly he has been treated by the blues hierarchy. How he was not even given a chance. There has been widespread criticism by the media aimed at the club administration over the handling of one of the most important posts at a football club. I have trying to take it all in for the best part of two days now; trying to make sense of all these things and trying to come to understand the psyche of the club and their handling of their manager, the latest incumbent of the P45.

It’s not been long isn’t? Seems just like yesterday when the Blues lifted the Champions league trophy against all the odds in Munich last may. The holy grail finally captured, Roman Abramovich finally getting hands on the one trophy he had forever desired over anything else ever since he took over the club in that fabled summer of 2003. And Although Chelsea won the champions league, there was a clear indication that the team had reached its pinnacle long before that fateful night in Munich and was barely on its last legs, unable to sustain the intensity that is required to win a long grafting Premier League campaign. Abramovich sensed that too and he went after rebuilding the team all by himself.

You can appoint CEOs, Director of Football, Technical Director or anyone you want but there is only one person who needs to rubber stamp the approval over the buying of a player and it is none other than the owner himself. The huge wealth that he has amassed makes sure that Roman can cherry pick the best talent from Europe as he wishes and he does exactly that. The rebuilding process began in earnest in January 2011 during the by now customary harrowing winter bleak period that the saw club relinquish the title; Having coveted Torres for almost an year he finally bought him in January 2011 along with another personal favourite David Luiz. This recruitment drive came to an abrupt halt in the subsequent summer when only the brilliant Juan Mata was bought. And it took Abramovich the best part of a year and a Champions League victory to balance his financial books and go on a player recruitment drive to form a new spine of the team that according to him would serve the club for years to come.

Things could not have got any better for him. He bought the new Brazilian no.10 Oscar, German winger Marko Marin, Wigan’s Victor Moses, Marseille’s Cesar Azpilicueta and ‘THE’ most coveted player in Europe in Eden Hazard. He rubbed his hands in glee on learning the availability of Pep Guardiola and immediately pounced on him, offering him a mammoth deal only to be rebuffed by him. Amidst all this was the man who had won this club the Champions League in May to go with appetizer of the FA cup. No one really cared about him and I doubt whether anyone even consulted him or spoke to him regarding the signings that were made. It was clear then that Di Matteo was never Roman’s choice, according to Roman he was never going to be the man that would usher the club into a new era of success, a success that would be achieved with sexy football symbolisd by the tiki-taka brilliance of Barcelona. He wanted Chelsea as a Barcelona in blue.

But Guardiola refused to take up the job however hard the hierarchy tried and thus the club was reluctantly left with the only available option of offering Robbie a new permanent deal. After all this was the man who won the club the Champions League, atleast in our eyes he did. And thus he was offered the job and asked to mould a team that would provide Torres with the kind of ammunition that would make him one of the best strikers in Europe, again. Under clear instructions to play the Abramovich favourites viz David Luiz and Fernando Torres it was clear all the way that the manager was just a puppet whose strings were being pulled by the enigmatic owner. A bright start followed by the customary winter wobble as the club rolled from one big controversy to another which duly brought about the termination of the manager and with just 9 months into the job Roberto Di Matteo was gone for good having never been the man that was going to lead the club in the first place.

A shambolic Champions league performance which will see the champions being eliminated for the first time in the group stages, dismal premier league form since October saw the club pull the plug on his reign.

The picture is evidently very clear here, the hierarchy was just waiting for an opportunity to sack him. Their disappointing Premiership form was not that bad that could lead to the manager being sacked, with the squad in a transitional phase a blip in champions league was expected although not this bad. But the club officials did not have the faith in Robbie to entrust him with the team to preside over an entire premiership campaign. And to their credit the team’s form has been downright poor under his reign in the Premier League ever since he took over in March.

And thus he was ousted and in comes Rafael Benitez with all the history and baggage that makes every blue fan go red in the face. But Chelsea are in a no loss situation here. Rafa will bring in stability at the club, make the team extremely hard to beat and most importantly this is seen as the final gamble by Abramovich to make Fernando Torres tick and make him look like the 50mn pound player that Roman thought he signed from Liverpool and should he fail he is expected to wash his hands off the striker in the summer if not early. Rafa will make sure they qualify for Europe next season which would help bargaining with Pep should he be still interested to take over. Should that not happen than Benitez could be allowed to take this good work further and make Chelsea a force again. But there is one sub-plot to it they should become “Barcelona in blue”.

Make no two ways about it, Benitez is Abramovich’s choice and having ousted Di Matteo he would want Benitez to do well otherwise, well we will have another one of this crazy Abramovich bashing cycles again next summer. Amid all this the best part is – At least he is better than Mauricio Zamparini.  Even the greyest of clouds has a silver lining.

Till next time…………………………………………………………
