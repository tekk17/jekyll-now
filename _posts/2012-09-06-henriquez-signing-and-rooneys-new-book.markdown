Angelo Henriquez was unveiled as a Red Devil yesterday. It was relieving to see him presented to the media signing his professional terms with club alongside the manager considering the fact that he had undergone his medical way back in August even before Robin Van Persie. There were work permit issues that were to be sorted out and there might have been further complications down the path, but all is well now that the player has signed the contract and is ready to join up the with squad. He has been given the no.21 by the boss and it is quite a show of faith that he has been given a first team squad number. Coming to the squad numbers i have been quite pleasantly surprised as many new players were given quite high squad numbers for this campaign. Nick Powell got the number 25, Henriquez has been given 21, Rafael got promoted to the no.2 . Its been quite a big leap of faith by the manager when he has trusted the lads with so good squad numbers for this term.

Now, coming onto Rooney's book which has a foreword by Sir Alex Ferguson and will be out for release soon, the initial publicity is going on in the media with various extracts from the book being published to give us an idea of what to expect when it does come out. Whats more intersting is the content from the snippets that have been published. The have been very carefully planned releases by guaging the current public interest, we have obviously been very concerned with his fitness and his recent careless attitude and thus have come parts from the book where Rooney himself admits he has fitness issues and a tendency to put on weight. In another part Rooney comes clean on his equation with the boss and his now infamous dropping from the playing 11 on new years eve against Blackburn at Old Trafford. These things though make for a good reading also suggest many other things too.

Coming at a crucial time when we have been quite concerned with his future at the club and his ability to be a top footballer anymore, Rooney stands to milk quite a few quids with his new book release that marks his decade of life as a player in the premiership. I for one have been quite busy reading so many media articles interpreting the meaning of the revelations made in his book and the relation they hold with his current status and future as an Manchester United player. Interesting times await us this campaign as rumours may only intensify if Rooney discovers that he could end up playing second fiddle to Van Persie at the club should the new found partneship of Kagawa and Robin flurish after the early impressive showings. Uptill now he has been indespensible to us with any injury worries sending shockwaves across Old Trafford, I for one did not notice any this time around when he was taken off apart from the huge concern we had after the sight of the very serious wound he sustained.

With him being my most favourite player by a long mile, I seriously hope that he comes back with a bang and strikes up a great partnership with Van Persie up front to bring back the glory days from the Cristiano Ronaldo era when he alongwith CR7 and Tevez struck fear into opponents with some breathtaking football played at a frightening pace to win the Champions League in 2008.

Till next time.................................................
