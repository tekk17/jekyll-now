At the end of the game, the writing was on the wall, more so it was engraved on it. We just weren't good enough. An insipid first half followed by naivety at the beginning of the second put a full stop to our FA campaign in an underwhelming fashion. It is Chelsea who have been playing non-stop football but ironically it were we who looked bereft of ideas, imagination and touch in the game.

Sir Alex in his pre match press conference was bullish of his team's chances, undermining Chelsea's triumphs and strongly building up his team's credentials when he claimed that Chelsea had lost their chance when they failed to grab the initiative 2 weeks ago, when United were there for the taking. How wrong it turned out, it was just a performance of last rites as Chelsea made short work of this game without breaking a sweat to be honest, apart from two miraculous Petr Cech saves in the second half.

A campaign that has promised so much is ending in a whimper, a 15 point cushion will be too big for any side to overhaul even if we do manage to loose or draw the big games against City, Arsenal and Chelsea that await us. The picture has changed so dramatically in recent weeks, it was just 3 weeks ago when we were in a swaggering mood ready to brush Real Madrid aside, and now i am sitting here looking at a rather bleak ending to our season with a side woefully short of creative ideas in the final thrid of the pitch. That is where our problem has been. The touch, vision and imagination of our forward players has just not been good enough. No one has caught the eye in the final third what so at all.

Shinji Kagawa has flickered to little to make a telling contribution but atleast he has crucially linked the midfield and attack to a huge extent. Wayne Rooney our primary candidate for this job has been frustrating this season. He has regressed alarmingly. You can talk all you want on his goalscoring exploits for us but the bottom line is he just has not delivered enough. His link up play, distribution have been downright disappointing. Its that you expect so much better from him and end up getting frustrated when he looses the ball in crucial areas, his first touch has let him down severely at times this season in very crucial areas of the pitch.

Robin Van Persie who was signed last summer to be the last piece in the jigsaw has gone quiet of late. His link up and hold up play has deteriorated along with his goal scoring exploits. The chances that he has missed this season have been priceless. Had he taken his chances at the Bernabeu we would have come away with a famous victory, his misses at Old Trafford in the return leg, his late miss at Sunderland, and his near misses at Stamford Bridge paint a vivid picutre of what could have been. I had been thinking back in January that he was going to be that x-factor player for us, someone who would win a match by his sheer presence but it has not quite happened at the most telling moments of the season and to make it worse it would be very very painful if we loose the coming derby against City or the home game against Chelsea in May. That would be a real anti-climax to a title winning season.

I have severely criticised on how bad we have been with our play in the final third of the pitch and the biggest brunt of this criticism has to be directed towards our wingers. Valencia who looked like a world beater at times last season has regressed to an alarming extent so much so that he barely tries to outrun an opponent, attempt a dribble and thus rarely puts in a successful cross into the box nowadays. Ashley Young has been injured all the time, his career has never really taken off for us, perennially injured or out of form with his role in the team unclear, he fails to put in a decent ball most of the time ending up attempting one dribble too many. And as far as Nani is concerned, his career here is over. I would be surprised if he is offered a new contract. 

Quite a gloomy outlook isn't it. Defeat does crazy things to your mind. A lot to mine mind perhaps, these things happen so rarely for us that we hit the panic mode so quickly and label every single defeat as a full blown over mitigated disaster. I dearly hope we win the derby on Monday night.

Till next time...............................................
