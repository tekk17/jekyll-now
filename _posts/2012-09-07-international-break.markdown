With no top flight football being played for the weekend courtesy of the world cup qualifiers beginning tonight, it is going to be very difficult to find something to do other than watch football on saturday and sunday evenings. There will be international football tonight with England playing Moldova away from home to kick start their campaign towards 2014 qualification. They later face Ukraine at Wembley this Tuesday.

Aming the united players, Welbeck, Cleverley and Carrick are part of the squad. Although I would have loved to see Cleverley start the game tonight and also on Tuesday, I have a feeling that he may be benched for atleast one game. Manager will go for the experienced heads atleast in the initial stages of the campaign in view of the huge pressure the team will find themselves under should they get off to a poor start.

It will be interesting to see the approach and the formation that Hodgson uses for the games ahead in his so far very short tenure at the helm. He was expectedly very passive with his tactics at the Euros especially against the better teams. But when England come up against teams like Moldova and Ukraine, they will be expected to be much better in terms of their style of play. Having a good technical footballer in midfield like Cleverley will certainly help matters, with the impending return to fitness of Jack Wilshere, things could get much better for England this winter, Although much depends on how Roy utilizes the resources that he has at his disposal. England will surely be handicapped by the absence of the big void that is Wayne Rooney although he has not made any impact of note for the best part of over an year now, so his absence should not be of much concern.

Criticize as much as you like about the doomed Capello era, one thing Fabio did exceptionally well after 2010 fiasco was blooding in the youngsters into the squad and grooming them carefully so that their potential could be realized to the fullest by 2014. How Roy Hodgson takes it forward and how much of a chance would he be ready to give the youngsters to express themselves will speak much of his thought process and vision as an England boss during the coming 4 years as an England Manager.

Till next time.........................................
