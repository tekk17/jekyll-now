Mancini raced to the pitch as the referee had blown the whistle to full time. It had been a very heated finale for the citizens. A chalked off goal for offside from Aguero, Balotelli being denied a penalty right in the end; and the discontentment that had been simmering in Roberto for weeks came to a boil and out he went to confront those officials who according to him had been completely inept to not sight those clear cut decisions. Animated gestures, ugly confrontations and repeated disapprovals were the themes as the manager had a heated face-off with the officials who had robbed him of a chance of still being in contention for qualification into the next round[well, according to him atleast].

That vision of Roberto racing to the filed for me indicated that he has been under tremendous pressure, make no mistake about this, the failure to qualify or even make a fight of it has been embarrassing on city’s behalf. If you thought last year was the first time then this time it should have been the coming of age of this team, a step forward as this side was expected to build upon those successes from last term. But it has not quite happened this term. I had written a piece [here](http://tekk17.github.io/tkalawatia.wordpress.com/2012-11-08-mancinis-troubles-at-city/), a few weeks back emphasizing Mancini’s transfer recruitments and how they were in danger of going back rather than forward with the purchases he had made. Roberto right now is very rueful of the fact that his club were not able to get atleast one A-lister from the list that he had submitted to the high command in the summer, something that included Van Persie, Hazard, Jovetic, De Rossi to name a few. He ended with none and the failure to kick on from that triumph in the Premiership by building on it by buying top notch players are costing City dear.

Mind you, City still have some fine players in their ranks, a striking quartet of Tevez, Aguero, Dzeko and Balotelli, schemers in Silva and Nasri plus the bulldozing act of Yaya Toure. They are not deficient in any area if you ask me. But Mancini did make some changes in his coaching staff from last season that have made some telling changes. The appointment of Angelo Gregucci[non English speaking] has made a difference. There has been a change in the approach of the team defensively with their defence at set-piece being more zonal and less of a man-marking/zonal combination. And it will take them time to come to terms with this system but I don’t see manager having the patience to persist with it after the fallacies of his players when it has been employed. Lescott a fine centre half last summer has been made to look like to a total mug by these changes, Matija Nastasic, a player  I have been following very keenly has found it difficult to bed in to the team and add to that the uncertain form of captain Vincent company, and thus an uncertain back-line has hurt the team dearly.

The defensive problems for me have been compounded by the constant tinkering in tactics on Mancini’s part and it has thus left his players dazed and confused. His command over the dressing room and his players could come into question should City carry this dismal form into the tough fixtures that await them in the Premiership in the coming weeks as they face Chelsea, Spurs and Man United in the upcoming games. Failure to learn from these mistakes and build form here could see them go on a slump that will be very hard back to recover from, something that could see them relinquish their title, although it is still too early to talk about it. The much awaited return of David Silva can’t come early enough for the citizens.

Till next time…………………………………………………..
