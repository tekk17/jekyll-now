Last night’s defeat made me come out of this exile that I had imposed upon myself because of the lack of motivation crisis that I periodically happen to go through from time to time. But this being such a huge occasion that the whole world has been going all and sundry about it, I thought I too would pitch in with this big mouth of mine and register an opinion.

You can talk all you want of the f***ing red card that that sh*t of a referee handed out to Nani last night, for all the talk of tactical superiority and tactical masterstrokes from Fergie, the cold hard bottom line is that United did not manage to score a single f***ing goal from open play for 180 minutes straight against Real Madrid. We spent 23 mills on van Persie to see him miss and scuff a whole lot of chances on the occasions that mattered the most. 

This dip in form that the Dutchman has been going through came at the wrong time and has left us in a deep mess that we will surely come out but at what cost is still unknown, have another off day on Sunday and we could be out of 2 competitions in a week and what a bleak outlook would that be on our season considering we were speaking about the treble only a few days ago.
That’s that for me, hopefully we will overcome this huge crisis that we are in, yeah losing one game at United IS a crisis after all you know, hopefully we will come good against Chelsea and stump the defending champs out of the cup.

Till next time……………………………
