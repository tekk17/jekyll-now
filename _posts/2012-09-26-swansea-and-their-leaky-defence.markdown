It was only last weekend that after a very long time did I get a chance to watch Swansea play for the full 90 minutes. Having enthralled us with their fluid passing football over the course of the initial games of the season, scoring freely and earning huge acclaims from Cesc Fabregas and the MOTD pundits alike I was quite interested in watching them play first hand myself.

A game against Everton at home was the setting, a side that was only one of the 4 teams that had managed to beat them at the Liberty stadium last season; so I knew very well that this was not going to be a walk in the park. And it was clearly not, Everton were brilliant on the day, stopped Swansea playing from the back and pressurised them in midfield to concede possession. Their small midfielders although good technically never stood a chance against the hustling and harrying of their Everton counterparts, it would be apt to say that Everton got into their faces and stopped them playing completely, never did they give them a chance, to any of their players to lift their head up and pick a pass, the Toffees were that good on the day.

But, we all know that Swans can be stopped from playing by using that approach; teams figured that out last season as well. What has changed though for me is the defensive frailties that have plagued the side. Laudrup may have got the side to play much better attacking football but they have compromised on their defensive discipline, a change that might prove to be fatal. This was the one big concern that I had when I was greeted by the news of Laudrup's appontment in the summer. That one nagging doubt that I had was whether Laudrup would be able to adapt to the sensibilities of British Football and build on the sound defensive framework that Rodgers had established there; a framework upon which he had successfully built the fluid passing game that they are now so famous for. Laudrup has certainly made them even more beautiful to watch but defensively they have been far from convincing.

There were warning signs earlier too, before this game against Everton; Against West Ham they were fortunate to get all the 3 points, Qique Sanchez Flores was one of the main culprits for me that day, and he got duly sent off in the next game against Sunderland, a very poor defender for me, someone who rushes into tackles and goes in dangerously into 50-50 situations. Loss of Centre-Half Steven Caulker to Spurs, Taylor to injury will hit them hard over the course of the season. They were the two big parts of that Swansea machine from last season alongside the brilliant Angel Rangel and Leon Britton.

Laudrup has also stressed on passing the ball at a much higher tempo, which for me was one very good observation, Swansea were vey laboured in their approach in build play and took far too long to circulate the ball across the pitch with too many square passes being played. A midfield of De Guzman, Michu and New Celtic signing Kim was far too lightweight against an Everton side and they missed Britton and his tackling in the centre of the park. But Laudrup will now have to act fast and sort out his defence and focus on getting some nil-nils or 1-0 victories under his belt. It was the strong defensive resilience and organisation that confounded early season predictions from last season as the Swans miraculously avoided the drop to finish 11th; To do so again this term and save themselves from the dreaded second seaon syndrome will require an act something similar from last time as Laudrup now faces utpo the task of Staying in the premiership with his honeymoon period well and truly over.

Till next time............................................................................
