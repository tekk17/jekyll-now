These are tough times for Manchester City. They are treading into uncharted territories full of muddied waters, the going has been very tough for them as they come to terms with the tag of the champions and the realization that they are everybody’s no.1 scalp now; having started the season with some unconvincing performances and a lack of a clean sheet, has worried Mancini. There has been simmering discontent on part of the manager with the top brass at the club for quite a long time now. His repeated exasperations over the failure of the club officials to sign new players in the summer quickly is not unknown, it was one of the main reasons why they lost out on top targets Stevan Jovetic and Robin Van Persie. Offloading the already dead wood at the club was very difficult considering the salaries that were being paid; other clubs baulked at the pay demands and thus refrained from signing them. Dzeko to Bayern Munich, Adam Johnson to Everton or Carlos Tevez sale did not go through for this main reason. But with the end of August, City did manage to do some business with some impressive signings and some questionable ones as Mancini was able to add some fresh faces to his squad with arrivals of Sinclair, Nastasic, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell.

Well, I can run the rule over these players and make a judgement on how good they really are, but three out of the four are very young and have been bought with an eye on the future. Nastasic for me is a player with a huge potential, you only had to read the blogs about him on footballitalia to know how good a player city bought and the best part is he is only 19 and could develop into the next Nemanja Vidic as he is rightly touted to. Sinclair signing was baffling for me; and Rodwell if fit could finally fulfill the huge potential that he has shown over the years, his see-saw form and injuries have been very frustrating to witness. Javi Garcia has made an immediate impact and will grow into his role of controlling the City midfield in due time. I am very skeptical about the signings that City are making these days. And if Mancini does play some part in them then I can conclude that he does not hold a good record when it comes to signing players.

Now, don’t just jump the gun and castigate me by pointing towards Aguero, Silva, Yaya Toure, Nasri or Clichy, these are household names in world Football, and these players would have been successful under any manager at any club. It is the other players, the ones that are in the TIER-II category not the A-listers, that raise an eye for me. Adam Johnson could not fulfill his potential, Mancini finally ran out of patience with him, his questionable attitude and lifestyle were not to the manager’s liking and thus he was duly shipped out. Stefan Savic, the Montenegrin defender swapped for Nastasic, was a huge failure; Edin Dzeko hasn’t pulled up any tress here and has done nothing to justify the 26mills that city paid for him in the winter of January 2011. Alexander Kolarov too is hardly consistent and rarely produces performances of note. These kinds of questionable signings could turn out to be the sole reason if City fails on to push from the giddying heights of last season. The failure to elevate their level further could prove detrimental to their chances.

Mind You! City still have an excellent side to comfortably regain the title but the Champions League could prove to be beyond their reach, you need to produce a machine to win a Champions League, fantasy team producing sexy football rarely win the coveted trophy unless you are Barcelona of course. The point I want to make is City need to produce a relentless unit of players that will get the job done under tough conditions away from home and for this they will also require different kind of players; they may not be A-listers of course. Man United had Park, O’Shea, Fletcher to name a few that were a huge part of this machine; Chelsea had the unfancied Ferriera, Obi Mikel, Meireles among others. City have been following suit and been doing the same. But there is a fine line between success and failure here. Chelsea were at a similar phase during those giddying heights they achieved under Mourinho during 2004-‘06 and Mourinho went ahead and signed some big duds in Boulahrouz, Pizzaro, Kalou, Obi Mikel to name a few and thus stumbled at the most crucial step. At that step that would have catapulted them to greatness, instead it threw them back and thus lost that aura that they had achieved when they won those titles in buccaneering fashion.

Mancini, now at City is also at a similar step and the signings that they made in the summer will play a huge role in deciding whether City next take the elevator or the stairs. Throwing money does not always solve your problems as Chelsea from 2005-‘07 can surely justify.

Till next time………………………………………………………………………
