Well, we won the game last night, Got ourselves the 3 points we were looking for; Victory was attained in a very unconvincing fashion to say the least though. I could have expected nothing less anyways with our repeated failures to dictate the flow of the game in midfield due to the lack of a proper world class passing central midfielder. Yeah, I know I have these tendencies when I love to rant about our highly infertile static midfield that does not do anything good anytime anyways! More on that sometime later though.

We did produce some good football in the game, Kagawa was impressive again for us, Nani was lively but he ruined that show with a poorly taken penalty that wont enhance his already fading reputation at the club anymore anyways. Quite why Robin Van Persie did not take it is something I cannot understand, he should be the default choice when Wazza is not on the pitch. Times like these, when you really miss Wazza on the pitch for the influence he exerts and the performances he commands from the players, he would have commanded the kick even if he had earlier missed 3 in a row. That's when you miss him; News of him coming back in training and reports of a comeback at Anfield are doing the rounds. I would love to see him feature and play but if you look at his dismal form there, whether the blue half or in the red, its quite abysmal to say the least, so I won't be holding my hopes on him too much anyways. More thoughts on the Liverpool game later on.

Darren Fletcher made his comeback to a tumultuous applause as I for one was very very happy indeed to see him feature again, Don't expect him to cover every blade of the grass and run himself into the ground over the course of a game, it will take time, but I would love to see him become a first team regular again.

Three points capped off at the end of a disappointing performance does not make for an easy writing, but these are still early days with just 4 games into the new season and just one MatchDay into Europe. It will take time for us to hit stride and kick into top gear as the real business gets underway now. Some very tough trips, challenging games at home; in between an international break will make for a very intriguing next two months. Rubbing my eyes in glee at the Football that awaits me over the next coming weeks with Wazza's return also looming on the horizon.

Till next time.................................................................
