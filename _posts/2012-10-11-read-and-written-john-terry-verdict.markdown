Much has been said and written about the John Terry saga over the last week and the punishment handed to him for allegedly abusing his opponent Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road last October. The FA released a dossier revealing the evidences and apparent false testimonies, most notably of Ashley Cole which obviously as you know by now prompted him to tweet the #bunchoft***s rant against his employers, The FA. Coming to the point, I am not going to do moral policing here and write about the code of ethics or everything that is wrong about footballers nowadays. What I want to stress here is the apparent shame that these players have repeatedly brought on their club over their past indiscretions from yesteryears. Shooting Accidents, Wembley Tours, Romping in bed with best mate’s girlfriend, breaking the heart of the national sweetheart are some of the few incidents that I can properly recall that these two have committed over the years. The sheer bad publicity that the club has had to face over the years is huge. I do hope that the PR head there gets his due for the incredible job that he does at Stamford Bridge.

Reading these incidents over the past week made me wonder, whether Roman Abramovich might finally have reached that tipping point; the point where he has felt that it is enough and it would be for the better of the club that these two should be cut off. What kind of an example do these two set to the younger players at the club; outright indiscipline and philandering have been their characteristics and it would be not late before the other lads started picking it up. Hazard who has had a brilliant start to life at the club is a prima donna himself and what are the odds that he follows into their lead and starts doing some similar acts. For all the great service that the two have given to the club and been present in an era when they have won so much, surely they deserve the respect of everybody but after a point it does get annoying to see how these two have repeatedly drawn the name of the club right through the mud time and again.

Oh, I so hope that Roman decides to pull the plug and rid the club of these two just like he has ruthlessly done so with his managers over the years.

Till next time…………………………………………………….
