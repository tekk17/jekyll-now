I don't think I possess the vocabulary or have words strong enough to express my feelings towards the Hillsborough tragedy. For me no heavy words used or no emotions expressed could pay a tribute to those 96 people who unfortunately lost their lives on the tragic day of April 15 1989. It is in the words of Prime minister David Cameron himself the worst tragedy to ever happen in Britain in the post-war era. The pics showing loss of lives of people who were crushed to death at the Leppings Lane end remains one of the most gruesome images of the tragedy and still sends shivers down my spine whenever i look at it. Those various pictures shown by the media, the countless recounting of events by the people make for a very painful reading. What a nightmare the people might have gone through, who had to experience it in front of their very own eyes.It gives me tears when I read excerpts from the autobiography of Kenny Dalglish, him recounting those torrid moments during and after the tragedy and the events that followed. Kenny's poise and grace, the immaculate manner in which he handled himself during that torrid time made him a legendary hero not just in front of those liverpudians but in the eyes of the football supporters all over the world.

The revelations that have come out as thousands and thousands of pages of documents have been released this week, damn the authorities that were involved during the investigation either directly or indirectly. The role played by FA, the huge mismanagement that played a big role into making this tragedy catastrophic are brought into light through these documents. And what's more painful to note is that as many as 41 lives could have been saved if there would have been proper thinking from the officials when the events were unfolding that day. And the worst part of it is that these documents also bring to light the sheer wide-scale corruption up to the highest levels that played a big part in covering up the mistakes that led to such a huge tragedy taking place.

This could go on and on, I can write as much as I want regarding the sheer misuse of evidence and the cover-up acts that followed in order to lay the blame squarely onto the liverpool supporters so that the officials could dust themselves off this heinous crime that they had committed where they were responsible for the loss of lives of 96 people.

These revelations at least now put all the famous Liverpool supporters in the clear that they were NOT responsible for the deaths of their fellow beings and punish those that were indeed responsible. And now I sincerely hope that those vile Hillsborough chants are stopped for good. Fans [especially the Red Devils, I mean] have goaded the liverpool supporters with those vile chants and they have come back with chants about the Munich disaster. I hope these now come to an end and what better place to start it than a very well timed visit of Manchester United to Anfield next weekend.

Football needs its two most loyal and glorious set of supporters to show solidarity and come together to paint a beautiful picture of unison that will pay respect and homage to the people who lost their lives in that tragic summer of 1989.

Till next time...........................................................................
