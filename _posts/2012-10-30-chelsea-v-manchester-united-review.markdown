I had mixed feelings from Sunday night’s game at Stamford Bridge; I did not know whether I wanted to celebrate the victory, our first at the Bridge in ten years or probably feel a bit disappointed over the fact that all that came out of the game was the talk of inept refereeing by Mark Clattenburg. I am not going into details and evaluate his performance here; I am sure you all might have already read a lot about him everywhere on the internet yesterday.

It’s such a shame that refereeing and the fracas that followed during and after the game overshadowed a fine spectacle that English football had put together on its first Super Sunday of the season. We first had the Merseyside derby, English football in its full flow, yeah the kick and rush style of play; Everton were so breathtakingly fast in their approach that they never gave Liverpool time to  think, they got into their faces and could have won outright had it not been for the injury to Kevin Mirallas. Branding the toffees long ball merchants would be highly unfair as they did play nice football at times. And then you had the titanic, top of the table clash at Stamford bridge which had the look of a continental champions league encounter feel to it.

Yes, in terms of quality and the football on show, Chelsea v Manchester united was as good as it could get. For all the technical excellence of the Spaniards and the way we marvel at the Spanish clubs style of play, here were two clubs who got down and passed the ball. There were shapes to the teams, attacking patterns, defensive patterns, formations and tactics. It was for me a typical champions league encounter.

United started the game in a rough 4-2-3-1 formation with Rooney playing behind Van Persie aided by Valencia on right and Young on the left. Wayne here was content to drop deeper and combine with Cleverley deep into United’s half and bring the ball from the back. It were his surging runs in the first 20 minutes aided by good overlapping play on the right by Rafael and Valencia that led to the second goal whereas the first was a fast counter attack. Wingers here were typically different in their approach play for us, where Valencia was hugging the touchline and giving Cole a torrid time, Young sought to come inside and combine with Van Persie.

Going 2-0 up in the space of 20 minutes was sensational for us having played the best football of the season for that period but it did have its implications too. Chelsea started getting into shape, got back into their passing rhythm and started pegging us back. Defensively we went to a 4-1-4-1 with Carrick shielding the defence. The problem here was that in spite of having good ball playing players, we uncharacteristically lost the ball in our own half to compound problems. Rooney gave away the ball a few times and finally paid for his mistake deep into first half after loosing the ball again and fouling Hazard out of frustration in the aftermath. It proved fatal because had Chelsea gone 2-0 down in half time the comeback would have been daunting. But Chelsea deserved to equalize and bring back the game on level pegging terms, they played some scintillating football of their own. Oscar was terrific, and Mata was simply brilliant. The three magicians combined and attacked with élan, so much so that Van Persie was reduced to being a spectator after first 20 minutes as Chelsea came on in wave after wave of attacks that United did well to repel.

Defensive work of our team could not be faulted here, as we tried our best to be water tight, a bank of four standing on edge of the box made it clear that we were not going to allow them to thread balls through the heart of our defence, Valencia and Young guarding the byline tracking the fullbacks made it difficult for Chelsea to get in behind us in spite of their brilliant attacking play. It was a shame that the two goals came from mistakes with Rooney losing the ball and then fouling Hazard out of frustration and later Jonny Evans being caught napping by a beautifully chipped pass from Oscar that he should have dealt with in the first place.

And thus Chelsea equalized and the game was brilliantly poised at 2-2 and we were on for a breathtaking finale to what had been a brilliant game of football up till then. Never did I think of the events that would unfold later that would culminate the game into utter chaos by the end.

Remember how I had mentioned Van Persie was reduced to a spectator after the first twenty minutes due to Chelsea’s attacking brilliance, well after Chelsea equalized and made it 2-2, instead of going for the knockout blow they retreated and conceded the initiative to United. Robin dropped deep to create space that Young exploited with pace to latch onto the pass by RVP and race through on goal only to be brought down by Ivanovic, thereby denying him a clear goal scoring opportunity; it was a straight red card the moment Ivanovic tripped him and the ref was bang right when he made that decision. Mark Clattenburg had had an immaculate game until then and the sending off reflected his performance.

Chelsea were down to 10 men now, Fergie smelt blood and on came Hernandez for Cleverley and United went to 4-4-2 with Rooney dropping deep, if you think one red card was all that it was , you are wrong , the chaos had just begun. Chelsea did well to stay competitive after the sending off and when Torres had a chance to run at the defence, Evans suffered from one more of those naps that he occasionally has, he rushed onto Torres managing to brush him enough that led to the striker’s theatrical fall. It felt that the Referee was going to award a free kick which was right as it was blatantly obvious even from television viewing but something changed and instead he wrongly booked Torres for a dive and sent him off. Now, you can criticize the ref all you want here for this very wrong decision, because it was scandalous but Torres should not have been there on the field in the first place. That Kung Fu lunge on Cleverley in first half was dangerous in intent should have brought about a straight red, but going by the way Clattenburg was working the yellow seemed apt too. But it should never have been a yellow to Torres for that perceived dive no matter how theatrical it seemed to be. Now Chelsea were down to 9, and Rooney who could have been sent off himself for another bookable offence was hooked off for Giggs, United came in droves and Hernandez scored the winner albeit from an offside position. Cry as you like about the winner being offside but I won’t take any trash talk from anyone saying that Chelsea could have scraped a draw with 9 on the pitch.

Mikel could have been sent off himself in the dying minutes after fouling Valencia but Clattenburg having completely lost the plot by now wrongly booked Antonio for a dive here. So a [ref’s] performance that had been near faultless for the first 63 minutes enfolded into abjectness by the end of the game. The latter events that would unfold, the accusations, the injury to steward, masked the fact that it had been a pulsating encounter for the first 63 minutes, a game that had all the ingredients to be written as a premier league classic. Instead we woke up yesterday to all sorts of bad publicity, insinuations, accusations. Just not the type of news that English football needed right now after what has been a very turbulent year. The curse of October had struck again!

Till next time………………………………………………………….
