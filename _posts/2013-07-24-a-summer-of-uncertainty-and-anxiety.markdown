It has been a summer of upheavals, uncertainty and anxiety. What a ride the last two months have been. It all started with Sir Alex resigning in May, David Moyes took over; Manuel Pellegrini was confirmed as the new boss at the Etihad, Jose came back at Chelsea, Ancellotti added another glittering club to his incredible resume with Real Madrid and to round it off Gerardo Martino recently took over at FC Barcelona. 

Coming to in-house matters, David Gill also left his position as the CEO and Ed Woodward succeeded him. All in all it has been quite a seismic change at Old Trafford both in the dressing room and in the Office. Transfer news has picked up over the weeks and we have been pursuing players left right and center. Thiago Alcantara went to Bayern Munich, Kevin Strootman joined Roma, although I believe interest in him was almost non-existent and it was only his agent that was marketing his client to all the top clubs in England. Ezequiel Garay, who has been reported to have agreed terms, or a fee been agreed with Benfica for his transfer or whichever version you might have read/want to believe has also done the rounds. 

These transfer news have been tiring to say the least. And the biggest of them all has been the Cesc Fabregas/Wayne Rooney saga, that is just playing itself out. A case of player not needed / A case of player that won’t be sold, wonder which scenario fits for our club, or does both of them do. I will let you decide for yourself.

I personally feel the public zeal with which we have gone about our transfer targets has left a bad taste in my mouth. I had prided myself over the years on how we used to never unsettle a club/player by speaking openly about him or the speed with which we used to sew up deals for players and be ready to announce them come first July. Now there has just been another casualty added to the list of top players that we have ended up missing from past years; Sanchez, Ozil, Hazard, Varane, Benzema, Thiago  have been to name a few that we tried to sign over the years. 

As David Moyes comes to terms with the new life as manager at Old Trafford, the pursuit of the big ticket signing, a signing that can shape his legacy here intensifies. Publically courting players, failed deals, non-sensical transfer rumors aside this summer promises to be a blockbuster as we enter the final month of the highly over-rated Transfer Window.

Till next time……………………………..
