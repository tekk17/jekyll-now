The news is out and it has been reported that the injury to Van Persie is not serious and a normal rest will suffice and thus I can breathe again.I used to snigger at the gooners plight last season when they prayed the whole length of the campaign for RVP's fitness and now the tables have turned and its my turn to do so. But on the other hand, we are not quite so dependent on him as much as Arsenal were last season. For starters we have Wayne Rooney of all players in our team. A manager's dream and just because he has been sluggish to get off the mark, it does not make him a bad player overnight. Furthermore, the injury hasn't helped matters. Then we have the serial poacher in Javier Hernandez, who can score goal from the slightest of opportunities and Danny Welbeck, flavor of the moment having signed a new deal and rescuing Roy Hodgson from his first home defeat at the Wembley in a competitive fixture.

Now, coming onto the team news, its clear that Van Persie will not be starting nor do I expect him to play any part at all. Welbeck and Hernandez could start together if fitness concerns about Kagawa are serious and the manager decides to play safe with him. I expect Macheda to feature in this game, at least from the bench. Henriquez could also play a part if the coaching staff decides that he is fit enough with sufficient game play time under his belt. In Midfield, Carrick will start for me alongside Anderson maybe, Cleverley could be rested for his travails with the international team in midweek and last Friday. Nick Powell could also get a home debut. Very excited to see him play.

One interesting addition to the side could be of Alex Buttner at Left Back. There have been positive news coming through about his performances recently and he could well feature for us this saturday. Games don't come much easier than Wigan at Old Trafford. It could be a nice outing for him. Jonny Evans could also play a part but I am not sure whether he will start or not. Vidic will be fresh and fit and so will be Rio. And they may well start together, Lets see what's in store.

Biggest news for me has been the revival of Darren Fletcher and the huge strides he has been making fitness wise by featuring prominently for the reserves in the U21 league. The signs have been very positive and I am very eager for his return. Its typical Fletcher, isn't it. The lad has fought all his life for a successful career at the club. He may not be the most gifted of individuals but he is a typical example of making the most of what you have got. The fighting spirit that he has shown right from the time when he scored that famous winner against Chelsea at Old Trafford in 2005 to trying to establish himself as a first team regular to trying to overcome the repeated disappointments of missing out on a hat-trick of Champions league finals is exemplary. If you want a role model lads, then Fletcher is one. Salute to you Fletch.

Till next time...............................................................
