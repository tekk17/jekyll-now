Hi all. Its Saturday today and I am back with the preview of some of the important games from this weekend.
We will start with Manchester United’s home game against Queen’s Park Rangers. Having come to the end of what has been a turbulent week in the managerial world, it was no shock when I learned of the news that Mark Hughes was the latest managerial casualty who paid for his team’s woeful form to follow Roberto di Matteo into unemployment. His successor is the very affable Harry Redknapp who is expected to take charge of the team from Sunday after the game at Old Trafford. Rangers will be under the stewardship of the caretaker boss Mark Bowen. Manchester United on the other hand have been on a bad run of late. The Red Devils first lost at Carrow road against a strong Norwich side last weekend and then a very inexperienced side got beat at Galatasaray in midweek, although the performance in Turkey was very encouraging. After two games away from home first at Villa park and then at Norwich, we are back to the cosy confinements of Old Trafford as the Red Devils play the R’s first this Saturday followed by West Ham in midweek. Wayne Rooney is fit and is expected to start today’s game and considering how lacklustre United were in his absence his return would be of huge welcome for us.
The most worrying thing for me has been the lack of clean sheets. That has been very un-Manchester United-like this season. Having prided ourselves on the clean sheets count for such a long time, we have only 2 to our credits in the first 11 games and only 1 in the Champions League with 5 played. That is a very worrying stat bit but if you take into account the defensive problems that we have faced over the months and it is only now that Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have returned, then it puts into perspective our clean sheet record. There won’t be a better time than now to improve this stat as we would happily welcome two clean sheets against decent opposition as we begin a double header at home with first, the R’s today and then West Ham in midweek. A win is a must here as we cannot afford to go behind Manchester City with a visit to the Etihad looming on the horizon in the next fortnight.
In other games, as part of the Super Sunday line-up we have Manchester City making the trip to Chelsea on the back of a comprehensive battering n the Champions league. To be honest, both the teams have been downright abysmal in their respective campaigns and deserved to be eliminated. Chelsea who will be under new manager Rafael Benitez will want to end the poor form that they have been in since the game against Manchester United from last month. The absence of John Terry has been a huge blow as the Blues have conceded 21 goals in the last 10 encounters in all competitions. With Rafael Benitez at the helm their defence is bound to improve as the man is a pragmatist first and a purist later. Mancini who will be under huge pressure himself after back to back Champions league eliminations in the group stages, will want to lay down a marker to emphasize his teams premiership credentials with a good showing at Stamford Bridge. City have rose to the top of the league without hardly breaking a sweat in what has been a pretty lacklustre premiership campaign so far in terms of quality.
The Most boring team in the divison, Sunderland face high flying West Bromwich Albion at the Stadium of Light in today’s early kick-off on the back of an impressive win at Craven Cottage against Fulham. West Brom who have been the surprise package of the season will want to consolidate their impressive start with a strong winter period if they want to remain strong contenders in qualification for Europe. Some very astute signings and brilliant organisation in the squad have made the Baggies extremely hard to beat and this will be a riveting contest at Wearside as both teams look for a win.
Liverpool will be travelling to Wales to face Swansea at the Liberty stadium in what will mark the homecoming of former boss Brendan Rodgers. Swansea who have been very impressive of late ever since that wobble in September are starting to come goods as a team, as the new signings bed into the squad. Their defensive side of the game has improved dramatically and it has coincided with their change in fortunes. Brendan Rodgers will love to get one over his former employers but with the game being at the Liberty the Swans will be up for a fight and would love a repeat of that impressive 3-1 win in the League cup at Anfield. With similar approaches, this game is expected to be for the purists with some good technical football on show from both the sides.
AVB’s Tottenham Hotspur side will look to end their miserable run of games with a home win against West Ham United tomorrow, although it will not be easy. The hammers under Allardyce have had a flying start to the season as they in the top half of the table. The hammers will be tested with tough fixtures coming up as they face Spurs at the Lane on Sunday and then play Man United at old Trafford in midweek; the hammers will need to be at their fighting best to get some return from the next two games. West Ham who boast of one of the best defensive records in the division will be hard to score against, something that might prove difficult for an already goal-shy Spurs side who have been looking bereft of ideas and imagination ever since Moussa Dembele got injured in October. AVB will be under intense pressure, make no mistake about that as he will be expected to win at home tomorrow and cool the simmering discontent among the Spurs supporters in the second London derby the club will be playing in a week.
In other games Everton play high flying Norwich who have been unbeaten in 5; Southampton are at home to Newcastle United as Alan Pardew tries to overcome his first real test as manager at the St.James Park ever since taking over in January 2011; Arsenal make the trip to Aston Villa on the back of an impressive showing against Montepellier which saw them qualify to the next round of the champions league for the 13th time in a row and to round it off Wigan play Reading at the DW stadium today.
Till next time………………………………………………….
