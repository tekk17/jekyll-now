In the end it was a 1-0 victory that saw us through against West Ham United in the midweek game at Old Trafford. Van Persie broke his 3 game barren run and scored in the 31st second which eventually turned out to be winner as collected 3 points in the end of what looked like a routine victory.

But it was far from one, keeping a clean sheet has been on my agenda for weeks as the readers of this blog will surely know. Collecting one on Wednesday night was testament to the brilliant work that Smalling, Evans and Rafael put in. Rafael by the manager’s own admission was superb on Wednesday. What a revelation he has been this season.

Fergie deployed is now well publicized midfield diamond in the game with Carrick at the base, Rooney at the tip and Cleverley and Anderson on either sides. Apart from an evident lack of width the midfielders played particularly well and the diamond deployment was not a catastrophe like it has been reported in some sections of the press. And its use certainly makes sense. With our wingers either being injured or woefully out of form, the manager has been deploying Rooney, Welbeck on the wings at times and on the other occasions he has used the midfield diamond formation; and although the players have not been that familiar with it we have still shown some fluency but it will asking too much too soon to expect more when we know almost all of them have been brought up on various variations of the 4-4-2.

With this win we maintain a point’s lead at the top. The Manchester clubs have now started to leave the pack behind and it is looking increasingly likely that it will be a two horse race for the title which will add even more significance to an already hyped up Manchester derby due to be played next week. More on that game later. First we play Reading away over the weekend before rounding off our Champions League group stages with a regulation game against CFR Cluj.

I will be back with my customary preview of the weekend games tomorrow.

Till next time……………………….
