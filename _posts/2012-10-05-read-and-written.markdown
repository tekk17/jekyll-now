As we wrap our week, we come to the completion of a quite testing period of three games that ends with a trip to St.James Park on Sunday. Not much can be said right now with manager not having made his usual press conference at the time of writing so I will probably come back with the team news later. We have not come through this run of games with any kind of credibility, on the other hand it has only enhanced our worries that we had from the earlier games; and with the international break coming up, we will do well to look at our shortcomings and sort out our defense so that we don’t end up being woefully bad at the back. This trip to Tyneside will be very testing, contrary to glory days of yesteryears when we used to enjoy winning there, we haven’t been able to score in our past two visits and if you look at the highlights of the last game from back in January, you won’t be too optimistic to hope for a return of three points. I won’t be surprised if we started with Van Persie and Rooney upfront; Carrick and Scholes in midfield. Not quite a departure from the side that had lost so badly 10 months ago [Scholes for Giggs the only change]. Ok, I will keep my whining for some other day but what do you expect when you still have to rely on 37-38 year olds in important games even today, does not make for a happy viewing if you ask me.

In other news, Carrick has expressed his delight on being called up to the national squad for the upcoming qualifiers next week against San Marino and Poland, Rio Ferdinand who was not going to be included anyways learnt of his exclusion after Roy decided to reveal it while travelling in the tube on Wednesday and thus kicking up a storm in the process; quite what all this storm is all about is completely not understandable to me. I am very happy Rio has not been picked, why he does not announce his retirement from England duty and save himself from all this ignominy is beyond comprehension. Honestly, we could have done without this. Naturally Roy thinks he could be better served picking other players with an eye on the future and thus has decided not to pick him, an acceptable argument if you ask me. Ryan Shawcross has been included and Carl Jenkinson could also get the call up for the friendly against Sweden next month.

In other news, Chris Smalling has started training following the injury he suffered at the start of the season and is expected to have an outside chance to be on bench for the game on Sunday, More news on this later.

Till next time…………………………………………………………
