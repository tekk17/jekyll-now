We struck the bar twice, the ball was cleared a countless number of times, there were last ditch blocks, endless one on ones, there were some saves by Michel Vorm too and in the end it was going to be just that kind of a day when the ball just wouldn’t go in for us. Midway through the second half there was that instinctive volley by Robin Van Persie for a cross from the left that simply took my breath away, it hit the cross bar and I just felt then that this was never going to be the day when the ball would go into the net for us.

Rooney, who has been sensational in recent weeks, had one of his worst performances in recent memory as he squandered chance after chance. There were so many chances that had we taken at least half of them we could have gone 3, 4, and 5 up within no time at all, such was the gulf in quality and the superiority we enjoyed in latter 45 minutes.

But I cannot say the same for the first 45 minutes too though. Fergie decided to start with a 4-4-1-1 formation with Rooney playing upfront alongside/behind Robin Van Persie and defensively we had problems dealing with Swansea in this system, at least in the first half that was. It was a 4-2-4 where we started the pressing right from the front, the two forwards attacked the two centre halves and the wingers pressed the two full backs and tried to stop Swansea playing from the back and this did not work for us in the first 45 minutes at all. The lofted passes behind our defence into Michu stretched the play and Swans no.9 exploited the calculated long balls played to him effectively as he ran Nemanja Vidic ragged for the best part of the first half making a mockery at his lack of pace and rustiness following a lengthy spell out on the side-lines.

Swansea’s first goal was borne out of a Manchester united mistake as first Evra failed to track Routledge’s run and then everyone left Michu unmarked to put the ball into the net that was only half parried away by De Gea. In hindsight though, Swansea deserved the lead as they had passed the ball around with purpose and made some good running of the ball too.

The second half was a whole together different affair altogether. Having had a rollicking by Fergie at half time, United showed much more purpose in their game. I half thought that Fergie would ask Rooney to drop deeper and make numbers in midfield that would provide cover for our central midfielders but Fergie stuck to his original game plan and as the Swansea players tired, the United players capitalized, pressed relentlessly from the front and created a whole lot of mistakes making them give the ball away in some very dangerous positions; these  moments led to chances being created which for some reason were not taken; we failed to capitalise on none of the excellent chances that we conjured through our pressing and good passing game. Fergie looked flabbergasted and aptly took Rooney off at the end of what had been a very disappointing 78 minutes.

Coming to the players, Nemanja Vidic made his first start since his long layoff from injury and took some time coming to terms with the pace of the game as he looked out of sorts in dealing with Michu in the first half but as the game went on he grew in stature and with that grew Manchester United’s dominance in the game. So imperious was he in covering the ground and clearing off the ball with those powerful headers that Swansea created nothing of note in the second half. That United failed to win the game was a huge travesty in itself.

On a finishing note, I will have to give credit where it is due; I may not be a big fan of him but Michael Carrick for me gave one of his best performances in a United shirt. He was excellent yesterday. His reading of the game, positional sense, and tactical awareness were top notch and his passing was at its incisive best. Every single pass was purposeful and he imposed real authority on the game. Fergie’s belief that Carrick comes into his own only by late November- early December ran so true across the Liberty stadium yesterday as he gave a performance of real class and was my Man of the Match. In an era of smash and grab midfielders Carrick brings a sense of calmness to our game and truly is one of our most underrated and important players.

That’s all for now; Enjoy the festivities and the games that follow.

Till next time……………………………………………
