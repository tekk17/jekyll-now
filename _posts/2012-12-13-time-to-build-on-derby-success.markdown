I would not blame you if you are still smarting from the win over Manchester City from last weekend. I am still revelling in the fact that we went into the enemy’s territory and did what Manchester United do, score in injury time with a smashing winner and then celebrate it wildly to rub it in. For me the best part was that the lads knew perfectly well how important this game was for us, you could tell it by the wild celebrations that took place post the winner, <del>those nasty attacks withstanding</del>, it was such a sight to watch and join into the celebrations. Moments like these make you realise how blessed you are to support Manchester United. This result will go some way to soothe the pain of the wounds that were inflicted that afternoon in May when we saw our title stolen from us in the last minute of the season.

Evra who later revealed that should we do the same again this season and squander an 8 point lead with 6 games to go into the season then that could lead to the entire squad being sacked. That’s how scared the players are of Fergie’s hairdryer. It so clearly puts things into perspective, the manger still retains the respect of the players and the players in turn want to play for the manager and run themselves into the ground for him.

Enough of all the post derby hangover, we need to get back to serious business now. It’s December and the games start coming really thick and fast over the coming weeks and it is of paramount importance that we make sure that we don’t end up squandering precious points and cede the advantage back to City. This time last year, we went into the Christmas fixtures on the back of some excellent victories only to see all the good work thoroughly wasted by back-to-back defeats against Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United in the New Year. The run-in is not daunting in the slightest but with so many games that will come thick and fast we will need to be at our best to ensure that we get a decent return of points from the coming fixtures. We usually have enjoyed unprecedented amount of success down the years in this period leading up to Christmas and New Year, something that we then use as a springboard for further success as we stake a claim for the title come February –March and push through the Champions League fixtures as they come along. This time too we will need to step up a gear, use the recent derby win as a platform to build upon as we look to steamroll through the coming games accumulating points along the way.

It is Sunderland this week at Old Trafford, our captain Nemanja Vidic is expected to feature in the game and this will be such a huge plus point for us in the defensive department. Although how well he gels into the current setup and how quickly that happens will be very crucial for us;

Let the games roll.

Till next time…………………………………
