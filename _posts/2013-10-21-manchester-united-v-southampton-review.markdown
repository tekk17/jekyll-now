![Saints]({{ site.url }}/images/article-2468891-18DD625900000578-168_634x482.jpeg)

Having waited for the entire week, in this case it was a painful starvation of a fortnight; I expected a certain degree of improvement but witnessed the same mediocrity as was seen at Sunderland two weeks ago.

Please forgive me if you feel that my thoughts have become monotonous over the past few weeks. But I cannot help myself from expressing exasperation every single time I see my team trod out on to the pitch. The players hardly seem up for a fight, let alone a war; there seems to be no hunger or a winning attitude, it feels as if they are going through the motions, expecting that they will win and it is just not happening. The lack of real competition for places has not helped as some of them have gone into a shell of complacency while others have suddenly turned mediocre.

8 games into the tenure, and still there seems to be no clarity in a footballing sense whatsoever on the direction this team is taking. The only signs have been of regression, staleness and lack of ideas as we have struggled to impose any kind of authority on the pitch. It was a nightmare watching the game on Saturday as we played as the away team at Old Trafford, sitting back letting the Saints players have the ball and hit on the counter. It was unbelievable and this kind of reactive attitude is what has never been associated with us at least at home.

There is no definite shape to the team, players are unsure of their roles, the central midfielders seem to be running all the time, and we just aren’t playing with a degree of calmness and assurance at all. The poise when we have the ball, the movements off it, the possession for longer periods are all gone. One thing that we have improved in is on the counter. And we played on the counter at Old Trafford.

I have been a big supporter of our new manager and I will forever be, but that won’t stop me from criticizing some of the rather baffling decisions that are being made. His failure to incorporate Shinji Kagawa has been most the most obvious one, why can’t he be simply put on the left, let him drift inside, combine with his teammates and free up space on the flank for Evra to bomb forward, sounds simple isn’t it? I am missing something here if someone manages to explain it to me why this won’t work for us. In fairness to Kagawa, Januzaj has been doing brilliantly to keep him out of the team, so no questions there.

The most worrying part has been the lack of options to find teammates when we have the ball, the gap between the midfield and forward line seems too large all of a sudden. While it would be very unfair to point the finger solely at Fellaini as he is only acclimatizing himself to the surroundings, it seems implausible to me how we are finding it so difficult to ping together 4 passes. We have started playing like England all of a sudden, and that is worrying to say the least.

As Moyes has stressed that we have been slow starters for ages now and we kick into gear in the winter, I dearly hope this turns out to be true as we badly need to get a run going to build some rapidly draining confidence if we have to have a chance of finishing in the top 4 come May. For starters, a definite philosophy about how we want to play, a stable playing 11 with properly well defined roles for every single one of them could suffice.

Enjoy the midweek Champions league games.

Till next time……………………..

P.S. the Jack Wilshere goal was a thing of beauty, could be goal of the season, but one of the best goals ever? give me a break, Barcelona do that as a way of living
