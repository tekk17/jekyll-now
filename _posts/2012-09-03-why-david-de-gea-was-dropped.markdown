As excited as I was to see us play last evening, I could not conceal my heartfelt disappointment on seeing the team sheet for yesterday's game at Southampton. My favourite player and United no.1 David De Gea dropped and left on the bench did make for a very painful sight. I like this guy very much, he is a very good shot stopper, an excellent distributor of the ball both with his hand and feet. But he does tend to get a bit cocky in his performances from time to time.

Fergie knows how to handle players, especially the younger ones. When he realised the slightest onset of cockiness and over confidence in the lad he decided to act. The huge mix up with captain Vidic for the second goal against Fulham which set up for a very nervy ending last week and an earlier drag-back cum backheel in his own 6-yard box due to an heavy first touch and writing was on the wall.

Sensing complacency and over confidence, Fergie decided to act, gave the player a big dressing down first in the dressing room and then in the media by confirming that he was indeed dropped because of his antics against Fulham. It will certainly give some much needed time to ponder regarding his performances as its the International break coming up.

I was expecting our no.1 to walk into that no.2 slot in his national team right now on the back of some impressive performances with us, especially when you look at how his older peers have been floundering. Valdes has had a shaky start to the season with some high profile errors in the Super Copa clash against Real Madrid and Pepe Riena whose place David will surely be expected to take up in the near future has been regressing steadily over the past 18 months. Reina for one could very well do with a change of surroundings. His alarming decline has been quite symptomatic of the recent decadence that his club have gone through in the same period.

I expect David to start the next game at home to Wigan in two weeks time having learnt his lesson and produce those jaw dropping displays that he has produced quite so brilliantly over the best part of this year.

Till next time............................................
