Things have started to brighten up a bit. But the pessimist in me is mindful of this and advises me to exercise caution, but I do feel a bit upbeat right now. The performance against Stoke City in the final half an hour was a positive and then the win against an utterly mediocre Norwich City side was soothing. Add to it a winnable yet tricky game at Craven Cottage on Saturday; the outlook does brighten up a bit as we enter the chilling winters.

Now coming to the point, as the pessimist in me as fully taken over, it is pretty hard to overlook the shambles we have been in defensively. While Jonny Evans remains a centre half of good caliber, he is yet to attain an authority of a leader on the pitch. It was quite glaring to watch how disorganized we were at the back. The absence of a leader, barking orders and marshalling his troops was galling; A Vidic/Ferdinand figure missing on the pitch hurt us to an extent. Expecting so much from Evans may be a bit too much at the moment. On the other hand Smalling and Jones for me have been downright disappointing. While Smalling is perennially injured or played out of position, Phil Jones just hasn’t progressed as much as we would have hoped.

Jones in particular, is the more frustrating case of the pair, because of the huge potential that is visible to everyone. Two years on, the lack of maturity in his game is evident. As readers of my blog will know, I have repeatedly pointed out his failure to read the game, intercept passes and understand the flow of play. His defending is too last ditch at the moment. The mindset to be everywhere, to win every ball is hurting his game. While there is no doubt about the ability he possesses, the coaching task has a tough task on their hands polishing this rough exquisite diamond.

Coming to another young prodigy, Tom Cleverley; I still remember how beautifully he burst onto the scene back in 2011. Positioned in the centre of the pitch, demanding ball in tight areas, showing close control, playing tight short passes he was a sight to behold. And then he got injured. Last season he began well and then petered out rather disappointingly in the second half. He has picked up from where he left off last May, lacking in confidence, he has turned in one dodgy performance after another. Losing the ball regularly has affected his game which in turn has affected his defensively too. Reviving him will be a big challenge and pivotal to our chances as he is our own academy lad who we badly want to see succeed. We Mancunians really do love our boys from the academy.

I had started off on an optimistic note but gave a rather gloomy outlook on some of our young prospects. Manchester United as a club has steadfastly backed youngster to the core as history so proudly suggests and we are equally proud of this heritage too. The joy we get when these unpolished gems come off age and deliver is priceless. The commanding performance that Evans gave at the Bernabeu last February, Rafael having a blinder of a season, De Gea being picked in the team of the year were beautiful proud moments that you love to treasure. And it is our duty now to stand by our young lads when they struggle, fall down; so that when they start flying again, it will be us who will be the happiest.

Enjoy your Diwali. Be happy and safe.

Till next time…………………………….
