At final whistle, Steven Gerrard's expressions said it all; The sheer disbelief etched on his face, failing to accept defeat, failing to come to terms with how his team managed to loose the game was understandable. For me, over the course of 90 minutes, Liverpool had been by far the better team without the shadow of a doubt. United were dominated to an embarrassing extent at Anfield. Such was the midfield brilliance of the Reds in the first half that United barely managed to string together four passes, we were that bad on the day. Had Jonjo Shelvey kept his cool and been a bit more sensible then he could well have won the game for his side. In the end, a few inches were all that separated the two teams, had Pepe Reina been able to deflect that Van Persie penalty more cleanly, Liverpool would have earned at least a point that their heroic effort had duly deserved; but we won and we left with a victory from Anfield, our first in almost 4 years, a win that I am embarrassed to acknowledge, we were that bad yesterday.

OK, hit me in the face but this won't be the first time and nor will it be the last time that I will be whining about our poor midfield. Its so easy for us to get dominated nowadays, boss our midfield and thus gain the initiative against us, and you will end up creating chances. Rio Ferdinand did save our face from humiliation yesterday by reading the game well and making some good tackles and interceptions. I frankly am tired of speaking about our midfield problems and I am not going on about this again right now, no matter how greater the urge I have to speak about it. Leaving out Cleverley was understandable, but I would have expected Scholesy to start, at least to have  played the first 60 minutes or so; But manager had different ideas, and it was quite understandable too. He knew that Liverpool would start at a very high tempo and he was willing to concede the early initiative to them as long as we were convincing at the back and it did work to some extent as we rarely had any heart-in-mouth moments in the first half. What he might not have expected was for Nani to give one of his worst performances in a United shirt. His confidence was badly down after that penalty incident in midweek and his sloppy play here did not help matters either. Manager also should be blamed for this, he is responsible in the way he has handled the lad, openly criticizing his performance after the game in midweek did not help his confidence and thus the dreadful game he had at the weekend.

Shelvey's sending off changed the game in our favour, he was a bit stupid in his challenge and the incident that later followed, had he shown the same calmness and assurance in his behaviour that he has in his game then maybe he would not have gone into that challenge the way he did and neither would he have later acted in the manner he did. The winning goal, the penalty was a very soft one indeed, for me it never was a penalty; The referee had a bad game, made some questionable decisions, but you cannot criticize him completely; Having been on the receiving end of some questionable decisions at Anfield over the years, we were due some luck and we got all the pent up balance in one single game itself! Quite incredulous haan!

Game is over, I for one in spite of the victory would want this game completely out of our system by today itself. Cannot even make myself tease my mates over the win such has been the performance of ours, I for one am very very worried as I look ahead over the course of the season.

Don't know how long will I have to wait to see a game against a top team where we would convincingly win by bossing the midfield and not, only the flanks,

One Word - ADMIRATION : for the way the both the set of fans behaved themselves and the show they put on yesterday, proud of you, you did not let your huge community of supporters down, FOOTBALL WAS THE WINNER  <del>[i dont give an eff about those pathetic ones who disgraced themselves yesterday, not worth mentioning at all]</del>

Till next time...............................................................................
