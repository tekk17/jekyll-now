By far the most difficult transfer window we have faced came to an end last night, with the approach and manner in which the targets were pursued leaving a very bitter taste in the mouth.

I will start with an anomaly of an Indian arranged marriage setup. A boy goes to see a girl at her place, the girl is completely besotted by the boy and is willing happily to enter into a wedlock, ready to make compromises; the boy on the other hand has mixed emotions, for him, he has seen better girls elsewhere but he has got to the point when he needs to make a final decision before time/age runs out. so what does the boy choose? His ego comes in the way and he walks away from a beautiful proposal that the other party badly wanted.

Ring any bells? This is what happened over the weekend and culminated into the shambolic events of last night. Ed Woodward (we will get hold of him later on) first showed utter blindness to the stark fact that only triggering the release clause of Herrera would lead to a transfer and submitted a bid on Friday that was always going to be rejected. This first led to wastage of precious negotiation time and secondly showed an utter disregard to the open knowledge that Bilbao would never sell unless the player's release clause was met. The player himself was very much interested in the move; After United verbally made it clear that they would match his release clause price on Monday, Bilbao allowed Herrera to enter into negotiations with United. Herrera completely besotted by United's interest and the prospect of playing at Old Trafford agreed a pay-cut to a 5-year deal and the only thing that remained was the deposition of the fees i.e. the release clause amount.

This is where the ego of Manchester United kicked in. Club officials developed cold feet at the thought of paying 30mn pounds for a player that would mainly operate in the centre of midfield passing the ball to other players, presumably they thought that paying that much amount of money for a central midfielder was not acceptable and so walked away and in the process spread the bogus impostor theory. This impostor theory that you might have surely read by now is so embarrassing and shows our club officials in such poor light, that we have now become the laughing stock across the whole of Europe.

Coming to the Fellaini deal, a player Sir Alex would never have signed otherwise. Its been apparent all along that United had more than a passing interest but it was also clear that the player never oozed class of United's quality. But if were really interested from the get go on signing him, why wasn't this deal wrapped up earlier. The trick was to sign him for a lower fee after his buyout clause of 23.5mn expired on 31st of July and you know what happened yesterday, as we ended up paying 27 and a half million on a box to box midfielder who has a propensity to get booked, an average passing ability and no vision for a killer pass in the final third.

The less said about the rumored approaches for Khedira, Coentrao and Baines the better. And now we come to the biggest culprit, our new chief executive Ed Woodward. To say that he has bungled in the most high profile job in world football is an understatement. The foolish approach in pursuing transfer targets, openly using the media and making non-sense and derisory bids for players was unforgivable. Keeping tradition in mind, when we conducted all our businesses in a dignified manner, never publicly commenting on the players or their clubs, this was an unacceptable approach and showed the club in poor light. It also clearly showed that this man did not manage to learn a single thing from David Gill and how he used to conduct business over the years. A serious performance review awaits him and he will have some serious answering to do on the botched up transfer deals that dragged the club's name right through the mud over the summer.

It was always gong to be a difficult window, there was no doubt about that, but few would imagined such a farcical unfolding of events and lack of hindsight shown by officials at the top echelons of the club. This is a missed opportunity of such a huge magnitude whose effects will be sorely felt come next May both on the pitch as well as on the balance sheet.

Thankfully we have a manager who is an excellent coach and has made his name making the best use of the resources available at his disposal. The window maybe gone, thank goodness for that; but the real season begins in a fortnight's time on Saturday week against Crystal Palace at home in what will be one of our most crucial campaign in many a years.

Till next time..................................
