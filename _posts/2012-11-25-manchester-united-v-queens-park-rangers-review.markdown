It was an average performance by us yesterday as we won the game, coming from behind to beat a resolute Queen’s Park Rangers side 3-1. Having started the game in a sluggish manner, devoid of any urgency or fluency, something that has been typical of us in recent weeks, we ended the first half goalless.

But the second half sprang into life the moment Jamie Mackie scored from a corner and this goal managed to rejuvenate the side something that not even Fergie’s hairdryer could do on a wintery afternoon at old Trafford. QPR went deservedly ahead in the game thanks to a set-piece but then Fergie changed the game on its head by his substitutions. Bringing on Hernandez and Anderson for Scholesy and Young, it injected a lot of pace and zest in the side and this bought goals.

The first was a typically scrappy goal as QPR failed to clear their lines allowing Jonny Evans to bundle in the ball into the net. The second goal was another case of bad marking as United scored from another corner courtesy of comeback boy Darren Fletcher. What a story it was, to see this man score in his first premiership start for the side in more than 10 months. While he is still coming back into his stride, on his way to becoming that typical all action player that he earlier was, this goal will do wonders to his already blooming confidence. The third goal was scored by Hernandez through a brilliant assist by Anderson. The first touch to take the ball in his stride and to control it was brilliant and the pass by Anderson to set it up was equally good. Anderson who has been having a quiet resurrection himself has been brilliant since coming back from injury and made a strong case to start the mid-week game against West Ham on Wednesday night.  All in all, it can be said that Fergie changed the game for good with his astute substitutions.

Onto the talking points, I had stressed in my preview on how badly we needed clean sheets. But all this talk went out of the window when Mackie scored to send shockwaves through Old Trafford. Title winning teams are built on strong foundations in defence, something that Sir Alex will proudly attest to, and for me it is the defence that holds a team in good stead during the tougher periods of the season, so it will be of paramount importance for us if we start incrementing the count in this particular column again. Jonny Evans was again faultless; amidst all this exhilarating attacking play by our strikers, it is easy to overlook the brilliant work that the lad has been putting in since making his comeback in September so much so that he is now one of the first names onto the team sheet for us.  Paul Scholes had a poor game by his standards yesterday as he failed to exert any kind of influence on the game and was one clumsy tackle away from being sent off. It is nice to see that refs take into account that it is Scholes who lunges in,in the only way that he can and there has been this leeway that has been afforded to him, at least at old Trafford where the refs seem to be a bit more lenient on him when he makes his now signature tackles.

Our wingers were very disappointing on the day. Ashley Young was a picture of frustration as he failed to produce anything of note in the game. A player of his quality and pace is expected to do more than what he is currently contributing and it is very frustrating to watch him labour through games. With a season under his belt, his career has still not managed to take off. He has not been able to produce consistent performances for us since his move from last summer. He is good with the ball at his feet, equally adept with either foot, good in the crossing dept, pacy but still you don’t know what he wants to do with the ball when he has it. He does not take on his fullback a lot, nor does he try to outrun him and the crosses he puts in are not better than Evra either. You do see him cutting inside from the left to combine with the forwards but if he wants to do that then he needs to score more or setup more than what he is doing currently. For me on current form, a fit Shinji Kagawa would walk into the team and take his place.

Now, since we are speaking about wingers, Louis Antonio Valencia has been out injured and is expected to miss the game against West Ham on Wednesday. No new news on Nani at the time of writing. The decline of this one time Players’ player of the year has been disappointing to watch. The handling of the lad could also be questioned, something that has played a role in the confidence of the player being shot to pieces. And by now it has become quite clear that he will be shipped out in January should a sizeable bid come in or could be delayed until summer but his departure seems imminent.

One last word, hats off to our star player Robin Van Persie who worked his socks off trying to score yesterday but the ball just wouldn’t go in for him. It’s been three games since he last scored for us in the premiership. He was denied twice by the crossbar at Villa Park, then by a brilliant John Ruddy at Norwich and yesterday by some brilliant last ditch blocks by Shaun Derry among others as he failed to find the net. But it’s not a worrying sign at all. He is not out of form or out of touch and just a matter of time before he finds the net again.  On the other hand his partner in crime Wayne Rooney who made a comeback of sorts after a week or so out looked very sluggish. His distribution was not up to scratch and his first touch was also missing. But Wayne being Wayne and the engine that he is, he needs a run of games to start roaring again and he will be back in his stride in the coming games.

That’s all for now; Enjoy the game from Stamford Bridge tonight.

Till next time………………………………………
