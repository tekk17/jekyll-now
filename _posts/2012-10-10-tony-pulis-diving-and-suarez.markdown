As we are now well into the international break; there has been no big news on the club front. It’s just become one big bore to tell you the truth. There have been some developments; Robin Van Persie is expected to escape punishment on the incident when he let his flying stray elbow too freely such that it came in contact with Yohan Cabaye.

On the other hand, there seems to be growing quite a huge noise on the current issue that has engulfed the premiership. While I certainly don’t like this thing at all, I am so against the sight of Suarez being vilified and chastised by all and sundry. That toad of a man Tony Pulis who is a practitioner of dark arts himself is trying to paint himself as the angel here as he cries foul on the issue and is screaming for everybody to at least consider the thought that the diver should get a retrospective punishment. If that is the case then so should those stoke players, who go about kicking everyone sundry every weekend on their way to those drab 1-0, 0-0, 1-1 results that frankly no one cares about. Really, no one cares! Not even match of the day and that says something doesn’t it. So if you want to have retrospective punishment for divers then so should there be for these players who go on kicking their opponents in the name of physicality and strength.

Suarez, Bale may not be painting themselves in a good picture here but the idea of them being branded cheats is not acceptable to me. Diving is not right, mind you and it should not be present in the game but the way these players are being treated is utterly unacceptable. Sir Alex came out to categorize that divers more often than not are the foreigners; quite conveniently forgetting the ever so theatrical Ashley Young is English, this is the same man who according to Jaap Stam, apparently used to encourage players to win penalties in the box and developed the serial penalty winner in Cristiano Ronaldo. As much as I like the great old man I do tend to differ with him on so many of his opinions, such as these.

And for all that Suarez is facing, to make matters worse, he and his team are in this huge rut where they have been unable to win at home a full 2 months into the season. The regime is utterly responsible for the mess that the club is currently in. Had they had the balls to support their manager during the transfer window and gone ahead with the Clint Dempsey signing, the situation could have been so much better. As a result we now have a prolific player of Suarez’s caliber who is excellent at creating chances leading the line at the club endowed with the responsibility of creating chances and also finishing them Surely it’s too much and to top it all we complain that he does not score goals! SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE LAD
