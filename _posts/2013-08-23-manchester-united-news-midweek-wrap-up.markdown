Finally after a hibernation of 3 months, god knows how I got myself through that period, Premier League and the football season as a whole kicked off last week. After what has been a rather frustrating few weeks in the transfer window as we have failed to get any signing done, the Swansea win was perfectly timed to calm the airs.

We took off from where we left off last season, having not outplayed our opponents for large periods, we were clinically efficient in front of goal to take our chances and went 2-0 up before Swansea could gather themselves up after the first goal, and it was always going to be a catch up for them after that. The performance of the team as a whole was pretty good, defence looked solid, Giggsy looked fresher although I would have loved to see Kagawa start, it was maybe the midweek excursion he had on national duty that played the manager’s hand come to think of it. All in all it was 3 points wrapped after a good day’s work at the office.

News this week has solely focused on the combined rejected 28mn pound bid for Fellaini and Baines; Everton labelled it as derisory and insulting, as if it’s a crime to lodge a bid against another club’s players. We are expected to go back with an improved offer and we should be able to pull it off unless some other club gazumps us to the deal which currently looks unlikely. While Fellaini could be a much needed improvement in the midfield ranks, I somehow fail to see the need for Baines in the team as he is 28 already. In an ideal scenario I would have loved to have seen Fabio being given a proper chance, but probably there is something that the coaching staff at the club sees otherwise, that may be the reason why we are pursuing a left-back at the moment. Come to think of it, I would have liked if a left footed winger/midfielder would have bought. It’s about time we signed a left footed winger. Tosic was the last one if I am not mistaken and he turned out to be a big dud, didn’t he.

All in all, things are proceeding as expected; I will get back with team news as we build up to the blockbuster clash at Old Trafford against Chelsea on Monday night.

Till next time………………………………………………..
