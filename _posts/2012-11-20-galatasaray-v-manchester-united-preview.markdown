As we enter winter and the games start coming thick and fast there is not enough time to dwell on the past. And thus we move on from the disappointing defeat at Norwich and look ahead to the game against Galatasaray tonight. But before we get into it I thought maybe I would comment on some of the few things that were apparently glaring in our defeat from Saturday. As much as I would want to move on but some conversations with a good friend of mine and also comments by Sir Alex post-game sparked me into making sense of what they meant.

The biggest disappointment was our wing play on the night. Both young and Valencia were poor in the game. With Rooney absent the onus was always going to be on the wingers to create chances and they failed badly, especially for a team like us that relies so heavily on good wing play. Nani’s form has been a cause of concern and so has been his contractual situation at the club and with Kagawa absent we were short on options in that position. Our languid buildup play hoping for something to happen by itself also played its part, something that clearly signified that there was mental and physical fatigue in play. Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes our old warhorses looked short of legs and our paucity of ideas on the attacking front exposed this to the hilt.

Which now brings me onto the team news for tonights game. Fergie has decided to rest most of the first teamers and has taken with him a very young squad to Turkey to face Galatasaray at the Turk Telekom arena tonight. Nick Powell is expected to make his debut, while Scott Wootton, Alex Buttner, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley are all in the frame to start the game. The biggest plus being the return of Phil Jones who is expected to make his first appearance of the season. What a sign that is for the team. One of our brightest sparks from last season coming back right during the time when the depth of our squad will be tested to the limit is such an encouraging sign.

In other news Shinji Kagawa is expected to remain on the sidelines for another month following slow recovery. Knowing the character that he is I am sure that he will come back stronger than ever when he is fit. He had an impressive start to the season in a different looking Manchester United side before his injury. He brings something different to the team and is the kind of player that we have not had in a very long time.

With qualification already wrapped up and the group already won I hope we register a performance of some conviction today, our performances have been very unconvincing in this champions league campaign and we have barely managed to scrape through with some crucial goals scored at the right moments; Hoping for a good game with probably some of our youngsters coming of age.
