For a moment it felt straight out of FIFA13, FIFA 12 or Football Manager 13 for that matter, you can take your pick here. Our transfer activity this window has been listless and lacking any clarity. After the botched up failed transfer saga of Fabregas, the Fellaini/Baines pursuit has been in the news and now there are reports of a 30mn euro bid being rejected for Ander Herrera.

Honestly, who in their right mind gave the go ahead for this Herrera bid this late in the window. There is a release clause that needs to be met, clearly knowing how the Spanish clubs function; if we had some sense and direction in our dealings, if we really wanted the lad from Bilbao we ought have triggered his release clause, and this deal is ridden from complexities and is a no-go from the outset. It has been just a ploy to make Everton twitchy on the reportedly improved bid of around 38mn pounds that United have made and which has been rejected by Bill Kenwright outright. Clearly here is another man who seems to have contracted the DanielLevyitis, but he does not have the cards to pull of this masterstroke that the Spurs chairman managed.

Reports in the media suggest that United have been quoted an asking price of 25mn each for Fellaini and Baines. I frankly don't know what to make of this. who in their right minds would pay 25million for a player that is essentially a box-to-box midfielder with a technique that is relatively lightweight with what we have among the current crop at Old Trafford. on the other hand, the pursuit of Baines makes no sense at all. We already have Fabio of decent quality in our ranks and Evra has been doing relatively well, and Baines will be 29 this December, what really happened to the policy of signing young players?

As the next three days unravel, the picture will be crystal clear on who the biggest losers and gainers were from this window and only then will we be able to come to a proper conclusion on the path we will embark upon this campaign.

Till next time..............................
