All in all it was good weekend for us. Three points wrapped up comfortably. Scholesy got on the scoresheet in his 700th game for the club. Buttner had a debut goal, Chicharito had a goal to his credit after the missed penalty, Powell came on and got a goal on his debut too. Makes for a quite satisfying reading, isn't it?

Well, it was from it. Wigan were resolute in the first half, add to that the sheer inactivity of thought by our players to move the ball forward at pace kept the score to a nil-nil at half time. After the break we came back stronger, we were much more quicker in our aproach play, moved the ball swiftly and thus came the goals. First goal was a very scrappy one, Al Habsi was at fault for that, second goal was a typical Hernandez goal, being foolishly played offside by Boyce, he stroked a wayward looking shot of Buttner into the net. The third goal was totally down to Buttner's persistence on the left. He got up, and just steamed his way into the box evading some poor challenges, especially one from Caldwell at the end before bundling the ball into the net, again it was Al-Habsi's fault but I would give this goal to Buttner for the sheer persistence that the lad showed. By this time Wigan were down and out, Van Persie and Powell were brought on. I for one was very interested in seeing Powell play, well he did not attempt much with his passes, but he did get an handsome goal, which was a good strike from the lad. I would have liked it if he would have shown a bit more imagination with his passing, but given his first game, I think he rather did well.

The team had a look of a 4-4-2 but it was different atleast in the first half to speak, Giggs kept coming deeper and central to recive the ball, making space for Welbeck on the left, his diagonal runs were a threat and he terrorised the Wigan defenders all afternoon with his pace, strength and direct running. With space ahead of him on the left flank, Buttner had a field day making one impressive run after another, and I have to give it to the lad for the bravery he showed as he attacked with verve and put some good crosses into the box. He was by far the more attacking of the full-backs. Technically sound and good in possession, we will have quite a player once he becomes more solid defensively. Petty fouls in dangerous positions and some poor positioning in and around the box during the rare occasions Wigan attacked clearly show that he is far from the finished article yet. But we have time on our side, Evra is not finished yet and in a year's time with sufficient experience under his belt he will be expected to come good hopefully.

Scholes was usual brilliant self in midfield as he went about his usual business with the least fuss. Marking his landmark appearance with a goal it was a memorable afternoon for all of us as we wrapped up the game in style. Next up Galatasaray at home, whom we have never lost to. More on that later.

Food For Thought : What would be the transfer market values of Giggs and Scholes today had they been 23,24, Just curious !!!!

Till next time.................................................................
