This is the second in a series of guest posts by [Noopur R Kalawatia.](https://plus.google.com/114578718211686922661/about)

There were times when I used to feel every morning, is a beautiful morning, the experience of a morning walk to the bus stand used to be such a beautiful routine. It used to make me have a good beginning to a rather smug day. I would notice the parents running hitherto the school bus arrived. I love kids, their unbridled innocence and their smiles could make any gloomy day better. I always used to notice the gardens that were well kept. People watering their plants, washing their car and the fortunate few who were sipping coffee sitting on the porch of their house and skimming through the daily news to find a good article to read. I always used to see my favorite three people on my way to the bus stand. The trio, consisting of the father, the school going son and their little adorable daughter, bobbing from the arms of her well-built father. The trio, made me so happy, their daily custom consisted of the father stalling the bus for his son and urging him to come running before the bus departs, the son running with the bag that hardly sits his little shoulders, and our little princess jumping and leaping from her fatherâ€™s arms seeing her brother running and making all the noises that a happy child can make. Seeing the three musketeers always made me elated, I guess I would never know why. Since some days, it became tough to remain happy in the mornings, everything seemed cold and lonely, nothing appeared chirpier enough to lift myself up, and the distance seemed simply longer and so unnecessary. It became a task that was to be accomplished. I was counting on things like my favorite music, my best friend, the unnecessary good morning messages to people to may be make me feel better. After a week or so, I had realized one thing, everything remained the same, the morning to all the people, it was me who was hell bent on feeling that things had changed. The silence I was inflicting on myself was so null and void, that it felt laugh worthy. The same day, I saw my three musketeers, after what seemed like a century ago. There it was that smile, the familiar contour on my face, seeing them hurry down the road. Those three seemed more close to me then the people I thought were mine. That day our little doll smiled at me and so did the father, which made my day. Sometimes, I guess strangers make you feel way better than the ones from whom you expect thousands of little things.
