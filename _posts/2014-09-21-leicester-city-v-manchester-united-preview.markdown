Hi there, it’s been a long time coming. I haven't posted on this blog for an eternity owing to personal reasons such as a lack of creative ideas or downright utter laziness to be honest. Now that I am back I intend to stay more regular with the frequency of my posts. Only time will tell whether I can keep my promise.

Coming to the crux of things, we have a game against newly promoted Leicester City today and it is going to be a tight one without any doubt. They have shown incredible resilience, bravery and doggedness up till now. Their creditable draws at home against attacking sides like Everton and Arsenal and their spirited display against Chelsea at Stamford bridge, not to forget their impressive at Stoke has earned them deserving plaudits.

Manager Nigel Pearson showed remarkable common sense in not trying to fix what is’nt broken ad has persisted with the back four that was so successful for him in the Championship. In doing so the back line of the team is extremely strong and organized something that only comes from having played a long time together. The central midfielders for Leicester will be crucial as United may play the diamond again, James, Hammond, Drinkwater will have their task cut out to as they would like to disrupt the flow of a team that has only started showing some signs of cohesion recently. David Nugent up front remains a bit of a worry as he tends to miss crucial chances when his team needs them to be taken. Wingers are expected to play an important role for Leicester as most of their attacking play is directed down the wings. That approach could be sensible here as United,, should they choose to play the diamond may provide more spaces down the wings.

Coming to our team, now that things seems to be moving fine with players getting fit, it would be interesting to see if the manager decides to stick with the same team and system or goes back to the 3-5-2. Robin van Persie’s form remains a bit of a worry right now and he could well find himself on the bench behind Falcao permitting fitness concerns; Rest of the midfield picks itself up after the strong showing from last week. Although there are signs of optimism, jumping onto this bandwagon seems foolish after the travails of the past year.

It is expected to be a difficult game and we will do well to come back with 3 points something that this side should do if they need to make up for lost ground.

Enjoy the game.

Till next time............
