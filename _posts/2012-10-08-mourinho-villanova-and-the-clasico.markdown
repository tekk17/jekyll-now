Complete with plots and sub plots the Clasico last night promised to be a classic and by god it did not disappoint. It may have been short on the quality quotient or on the tactical battles that we have seen from over the years but it did produce some riveting attacking football that was of the highest quality.

Mourinho going into the game had been facing a lot of problems within his squad. Sid Lowe brilliantly summarized the lot in the guardian with his succinctly put article in midweek when he laid bare the Mourinho-Ramos saga and how it had engulfed the strangely under-performing fatigued Mesut Ozil. For Mourinho, his reign at the Bernabeu has been very a challenging one. This man has always lived on his terms where he has been able to control the press, media and the team functioning to his liking, be it during his time at Inter, or Chelsea. It was always on his terms, he decided when he had to leave or what he had to do,no one interfered FULL STOP. The battle of winning over and controlling the media here in Spain has been one that Mou has not been able to win and it has severely undermined his authority in the dressing room at times. Everytime an El Clasico comes up and so does some kind of an controversy either before or after. No one can forget the ones that sprung up during those heady four games we had witnessed in April 2011 when his high handed tactics had left De Stefano and the officials at the club red faced or the apparent discontent among his players during the Super Copa side from last year when they appeared to question the manager’s tactics and making him play the Spanish way in the second leg of the clash at the Camp Nou last august. It’s quite clear isn’t it, always, a Clasico brings something new a controversy for Mourinho to contend with and this time too it has been the same.

Having seen his side humiliated repeatedly over the first two seasons under his helm, Mourinho learnt from his mistakes and slowly developed a brilliant counter attacking side that was easy on the eye and tailor made to beat Barcelona. It all came to brilliant conclusion last April when they went to the lion’s den and came back with the share with an accomplished performance that made everyone proud; Real defended, won the ball and broke at lightning pace to kill Barcelona on the counter. The pattern was simple. This set the model for the future, everyone yesterday knew what Real were going to do, but I wanted to know what Barcelona’s response would be to this.

The cast had changed; Guardiola, worn down by the battles of the last few seasons had departed and his assistant  Tito Villanova had taken charge now. Barcelona under Villanova have gone back to being simple and efficient, they are more direct in their approach play now, there is a bit more of a risk factor involved with their passing in the final third and they attack at a higher pace than they were under Guardiola, and although they are still finding their feet under the new boss, they have been far from convincing. Goals have been shipped, their brilliant pressing play has been subdued and this has led to a sluggish defensive form. But they have Messi in the team and thus have been able to maintain their perfect start to the league.

The stage had been set and the teams were ready for the battle. Real were the same team that had won at this ground in April but Barca reeling from lack of fit centre halves had a makeshift defence with Mascherano and curiously Adriano featuring in the centre back positions, other usual heavyweights in Xavi, Iniesta, Fabregas, Messi, Busquests et.al were present. Barcelona were subdued for huge part of the first half, lacking a killer pass in the final third; they had no efforts to show for their possession and Real on the other hand could easily have been 3-0 up by half time had they taken their chances but the game ended 1-1 at the end of the first half courtesy of goals from Messi and Ronaldo. Second half was much better, game was played at an even high tempo and had an end-to-end feel about it as the teams traded blows against each other, Ronaldo and Messi scored again to end the game at 2-2 in what had been a riveting contest where some exquisite attacking football had been on show.

The big talking point for me from the game was Barcelona’s defense. For a team that has been blessed with the best attacking talent of their generation they just don’t seem to have able centre halves to hold the guard at the back. This is one area where they seem wanting. And I quite frankly cannot understand why the club failed to strengthen this position in the summer, it’s quite similar to Manchester United’s obvious reluctance to buy a top class central midfielder isn’t it? Villanova a disciple of total football has taken forward Guardiola’s ideology in his style of play and plans to implement the style of a team packed with midfielers who are good with the ball at their feet, a team of passers. Guardiola had been trying to do the same last season, and it did work to some point, remember their mesmerizing performance against Neymar's Santos in the club world cup final in December last year, quite a sight it was to watch that night. But it has not sparkled in the way that it was expected to and Guardiola departed at the end leaving the dream unfulfilled and tasking it with Tito to take it forward.

This style of 11 passers in the team comes at a price if you do not defend and attack in patterns, as have barca been culpable of not doing this season. Their vigorous pressing from their prime days has been mysteriously missing, this pressing game is crucial to their plan’s success otherwise they stand a chance of being found out, something that happened against Chelsea or Real last year. Villanova for all his vision in the way the game has to be played just failed to come up with an answer to counter Madrid’s system, a system that has made them so effective against the Catalans. For all their possession in the field, Barca could not make it count and had to rely on a failed clearance and a brilliantly taken set-piece to come away with spoils against their eternal rivals. Not signing a centre half could turn out to be the fading off of the aura of this invincible side unless they can get their act together and lead us into an era where we see a team of 11 passers in the field that wins matches comprehensively and regularly.
