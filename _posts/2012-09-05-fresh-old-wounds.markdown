Its been a quite typical start to our season this term. We lost our first game, which does not happen quite often[although it means there are only three more defeats to see out this season], we came perlilously close to drawing at home to Fulham and almost got beat again at the St.Mary's Southampton had it not been for a Robin Van Persie hat-trick. But I am still not very worried at the moment. Not at all on the contrary.

I still remember the lightning start to our campaign last season when we went hammer and tongs against everyone with a starting eleven so young that it bought back those vivid nostalgic memories of the class of 91 that came off age in the campaign of '95-'96.Â  Hammered Spurs at home, trounced Bolton away, beat Chelsea at home and gave Arsenal the mother of all thrashings at Old Trafford. But that fateful afternoon at Reebok in early September changed everything for us. Cleverley got injured, same old faces came back, we slipped into our old routine, we were winning mind you but that excitement was gone and so had that aura of invincibility at home. And then came that hammering at the hands of the eternal enemy in late October, a beating that took place at our own home, we were ashamed and stripped to our bare essentials against our own crowd, and I dont know if you will agree with me or not but we were never quite the same after that.

Later we got eliminated from the Champions league in the group stages itself after some abject, we got beat at home by later to be relegated Blackburn Rovers before being getting sunk at St.James Park in the new year. Mind you we did recover very beautifully after that and led City by 8 points going into April only to see it squander by the end of the month and later to see our title taken away from us with last kick of the season by Aguero.

I was not quite sad or disappointed or say gutted at the loss of the title on the final day, for me we lost the title when we lost to Wigan, it became quite apparent to me then, that if we could not beat some side that were scrapping for their dear lives to stay in the premiership, it was quite obvious that these players never had the hunger or the intensity to win the title. Having an 8 point lead going into April clouded the minds of these players making them over confident and thus saw them flounder a commanding position into a vulnerable one even before we made that trip to the Etihad.

Always proud to boast of our indomitable record of coming good when it really matters, of being there when the title is there for the taking, we came up short at that same crucial juncture. I was so gutted to even watch the Match Of The Day highlights of last few weeks because quite frankly I did not have the balls to see our team capitulate so badly at a time when we have usually seen them romp home to the title in the finishing straight of a marathon season.

So I am glad that we have started badly, hopefully we will have a stronger finish to the season and bring back the title which is rightfully ours.

Till next time...................................................
