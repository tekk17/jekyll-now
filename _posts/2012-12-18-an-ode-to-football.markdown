Every once in a while comes a moment, a breath taking piece of play, a sublime piece of skill, a brilliant save, a sweeping counter attack that makes you realise how beautiful this game of football can get. A fan at the Etihad Stadium last season said that he would prefer to watch David Silva play than watch soft porn and comments like these ring a bell in your ears when you experience fulfilling moments such as some that I experienced this weekend.

Christian Benteke went to Anfield and ran the best Centre Back pairing in the whole of Europe ragged the whole game. During that process Villa conjured some outrageous pieces of play that sent the visiting supporters into crazy raptures. They went ballistic witnessing what was unfolding in front of their eyes as Barry Bannan, Andreas Weimann, led a wonderful supporting cast to the chief destructor Benteke and Villa came back with the three points.

At Tyneside, a wounded Manchester City ripped the Newcastle defence to shreds with excellent passing in tight areas as they weaved through the Magpies players and could have been half a dozen goals up by half time had it not been for some profligate finishing.

Manchester United at Old Trafford against Sunderland were brilliant in the first 30 minutes of play as they produced their best attacking display of the season and almost ran riot on Saturday before falling asleep realising that the opposition were not worth their efforts after all.

And finally for conversations like these you just have to bring up the team that metamorphoses sexy football more than anybody else, Arsenal; the diminutive magician that is Santi Cazorla scored three en route to a good victory against Reading at the end of what has been a very long week for the Gunners.

Moments like these make you realise how blessed you are to have fallen in love with this game.

Till next time…………………………..
