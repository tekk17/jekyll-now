One of the most prestigious football tournament is back this week as we kick off the Champions League group stages tonight with a mouth watering clash as the defending English Champions Manchester City face Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid tonight. This game is being surely hyped up to a huge extent, add to it the current turmoil that Mourinho has been dealing with at Madrid will only intensify the proceedings. Manchester City have had a decent start to the campaign, although they have been uncharacteristically pretty languid in defence, but these are early days and I expect them to shore up their lines pretty soon. Last year's elimination from the group stages will only help them this time around as they will be much better off with that experience and I see them being a bit less gung ho in their approach at least away from home early on as they try to establish some sort of a foothold on their group.

Chelsea face Italian champions Juventus at Stamford Bridge as they kickstart the defence of their campaign. I am quite sure there is no chance, repeat no chance whatsoever of them reclaiming this title again next May at the Wembley, but the press to keep the matters interesting and to increase the viewership have been touting Chelsea's chances, but for me they remain a huge work in progress. With a very lightwieght midfield and a team still trying to acclimatise themselves to their new style of play in a new system, I cannot see them even topping their group with Juventus for me to finish ahead of them. That stellar midfield of Juve could prove to be too much for the blues, and things might get interesting if Chelsea make a sticky start and on the other hand Shakhtar and Juve get off the mark quicker. It could be a potential banana skin of a group for the Champions.

Meanwhile, we too start our European sujourn tomorrow night at Old Trafford against Galatasaray, it should prove to be an easy group, but we said that last year too and we all remember what happened! Old talk aside, I dont think there will be a repeat of those calamitous performances from last year when we played with so much naivety, especially in midfield and defence as Fergie played too many kids to undermine our chances. The Manager has said that he has learnt from his mistakes and there would be no repeat of those this time, further emphasizing that a failure at this stage would be intolerable, we appear bullish in our chances to go deep into the tournament with Robin also being signed. More on the team news on tomorrow's game later. Lets just hope that we start off well and have a decent campaign, winning it seems out of reach for me as of now.

The fourth english team in the competition, Arsenal have been sensational of late, having played some excellent football they have arrived in Montpellier with a swagger, and the look of a team that means serious business. I have very high hopes from themÂ  this year. They have a good balance to the side, have a new found optimism and look relaxed in defence. The return of Wilshere to training will be a huge plus to the Gunners, but quite when he starts to play still remains uncertain. Mid October for me could be a realistic expectation at the latest.

With so early in the season, don't go looking for any champaigne football, I expect a cautious start from most of the teams as they test early waters. Ok, Just one prediction - City to come away with a point from the Bernabeu.

Till next time........................................................
