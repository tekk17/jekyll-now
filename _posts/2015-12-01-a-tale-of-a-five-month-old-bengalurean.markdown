A guest post by[ Noopur R Kalawatia.](https://plus.google.com/114578718211686922661/about)

I have been staying in Bangalore for the past four months now. These four months have been nothing less than a revelation for me. I guess, no place has tested me the way Bangalore has. The fervor of the traffic to the boisterous honking of the vehicles, the intense patience it demands from you, to the awe inspiring apartments, that make you yearn for excellence. Bangalore is a potboiler, it can mesmerize and exhaust you both ways. This city has made me see so many things in my life that I can safely say I am appalled, shocked, scared, stirred and scarred from it. This city teaches you, condemns you, asks you to go with the flow, compels you to achieve and also helps you relax. Looking at myself after four months of this upheaval, I can say that may be after all these months, Bangalore is growing on me.
It was a normal day, a rather lethargic ride back from Koramangala to BEML layout. Yes, you read it right, I stay in BEML Layout, for those who don’t realize the gravity of the situation(pun intended), I stay in one of the epicenters of the famous traffic of Bengaluru. I traverse the way of 17km with extreme will and determination and also make up my mind, to do the same every next morning. To those who want to tell, why do you stay so far, I stay with my family, Indian family, to all fellow Indian brothers and sisters, you know what I am trying to tell you. So, yes , every day is a learning experience in Bangalore is what I can tell you, here I have a lesson that I have learnt.
If you ever been stranded, oh please not stranded even, if you are just commuting, oh no if you are just standing for your bus near the bus stop, you have experienced a raucous and an incessant honking, from every vehicle that is present. There is a plain logic according to me in Bangalore, if you cant do anything about the traffic, you honk. If you see there is red light and you possibly cannot move, you still have a right to honk and make the other person believe that they are blocking your way. It makes you think what will you get from the relentless honking, but the logic for them is, what can we possibly lose. So a big sayonara to the most common, common sense and please just honk!
It made me wonder for an instance, why do we honk so much, and since I have been always branded as an over thinker of the group, It got me thinking, it is all about the rush. In this age where everything is a just a whimsical second away, we always want to catch up on that speed. Thinking of this the other way, we all are onto to this journey called life, where we all are at varied stages, just like all the commuters on the street. Everyone occupied, with their thoughts, the overwhelming gruel of going home and reaching places. Picture this, we all are stuck at the same place, we see that there is a red signal , but still we honk, we grow restless and crib about everything wrong with the city, the municipal corporation who is still painstakingly trying to complete the “Namma metro” which does not give us any breather from the traffic.(Atleast us the ITPL people :P), this is similar to a stage in our life as well. Sometimes, we are stuck at a signal which we thought would be easier to avoid, a phase of life, that we thought should have ended the moment it began. But life blocks you, the red signal comes as a jolt to the flow of life, it asks us to slow down and stop, reflect and learn. But not many of us want that emotional healing to happen, when my wish of buying a thing is fulfilled by a click then why not my life, is the thought that ponders. Eventually when life realizes that you would be able to take the ride, it shows you the green signal. While we wait, we honk in restlessness, hoping that the cacophony of our thoughts and the restlessness would help it become green, but that is I guess the beauty of the word, “eventually”, it never guarantees you of a time frame, it doesn’t ascertain a limit, the best part of the word is, it kindles a hope. So rather than mulling over and growing impatient, we could switch off the engine of our life, take a breather, realize why am I stuck here, what possibly can be the solution and how do I grow, so that when I move ahead, I am a different person. So I guess the next time you are stuck, please realize that the destiny means a naught which you haven’t learnt throughout the journey. On another note, the ones who honk, kindly don’t, we want to feel our ears when we reach home.
