![Sunderland]({{ site.url }}/images/article-2446095-188BB04C00000578-297_306x423.jpeg)

As United wrapped up three points at Sunderland with a hard fought win, several questions still seem unanswered and cannot mask the brilliance shown by an 18 year old.

For a large part of the game, up until Januzaj scored those brilliantly taken goals that Van Persie would have been proud of, it was a very average, unconvincing performance that made you question a lot of the decisions taken by the manager and his support team. The decision to start Phil Jones at centre half was the most perplexing one. It is such a shame that he has not grown into the centre half that we all thought he would by now. His lack of progress and defensive sensibilities has not evolved to the extent you would have thought it could have from two years ago. It’s painful to point that he has actually regressed to a certain point and is just not fit to play at centre half for the moment. His lackadaisical attitude to defending, miskicked clearances and failure to anticipate made Nemanja Vidic tetchy for the duration of the game and the captain became so uncertain by the end of the first half that he was barely a shadow of himself amid all the uncertainty surrounding him.

Sometime you wonder whether these are the same players that won the title last may. The hunger, determination and drive to get past players are missing. Rooney is back to the player of last season, Van Persie has been deprived of quality service, Cleverly just does not show the technical skill or the vision anymore that we thought he could. He barely tries to dribble from a tight area or tries a raking cross-field pass. Rafael was so frequently beaten on the flank yesterday, which bought back those days of youthful impetuousness that we thought he had left behind last season. Nani was just Nani to be honest, sporadically showing signs of what he is capable of doing. The lack of game time that Chicharito is seeing is worrisome; Moyes will have to use his man management abilities to its best to keep the members of his forward heavy squad happy. Already his handling of Zaha is being severely questioned. I for one would go a step further and question why Fabio isn’t being given a chance to play at left back.

Another concern is the new found love of playing a very flat 4-4-2 at times. At the beginning of the game, when he were playing with a conventional 4-4-2 the gap between the forwards and midfield was too huge for a ball to thread through a 3 man Sunderland midfield. We struggled to get a hold on the game, and at times when Rooney dropped deep to collect the ball, the brilliant Cattermole was there on his heels every single time. On other occasions Rooney’s touch seemed to desert him. In the second half, Januzaj started dropping deeper to collect the ball and that had a profound change in our dynamics and he kept the ball better, showing his dribbling skills and a passing range and vision to match. He could evolve into our very own Andres Iniesta, no wonder Barcelona are interested. Some of those raking cross field passes were of sheer delight. Things like these, seeing an academy lad graduate to the full team make you happier than a 50mn pound signing, watching the hard work of the coaches bear fruit.

Don’t get me wrong, after being under the protective umbrella of Fergie for years, when we would just convince ourselves by saying that he knew best and things would eventually get sorted out, the picture has changed now. Moyes is under scrutiny than any other manager has ever been before. His every move questioned, his body language studied, his celebrations, press conferences scrutinized to the minutest detail says it all. So much has been the clamor in the press to judge him that every layman journalist, blogger, or tweeter for that matter just wades in and starts questioning his judgment on all matters. We seem to have forgotten what Sir Alex had asked us in his farewell speech last may; he told us that it was our job and duty to remain steadfastly behind our new manager and give him the support, time and patience that would be required to see through the transition. And we will have to show patience, revise our expectations and do just that. 

Enjoy the victory that a boy of 18 year old gave us and hope that he stays with us for years to come as the number 7 or dare I say 11 beckons.

Till next time…………………………………………
