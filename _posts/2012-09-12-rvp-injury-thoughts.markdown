Ok, I will get back to the dismal England performance against Ukraine from last night later. First things first, and biggest matter of concern for me has to be the injury to Robin Van Persie while on duty with Netherlands. It has been reported to be a thigh injury, the severity of which is currently unknown. I am hoping for the best here. Sincerely hoping that it is nothing more than a niggle.

As a result of this injury it is expected RVP may not play a part in this saturday's home game against Wigan. I never expected him to play this weekend anyways either. We have far too many excellent strikers in the squad to hammer Wigan and would not have needed RVP if fit anyway either. With some very important clashes against Spurs, Liverpool and Champions League games coming up it would be prudent that he be rested for this weekend. So, If its not a big injury then no harms done. The lad will be just out/rested for a week and will surely back as fit as a fiddle for next week's crucial game at Anfield.

I would love to give you further thoughts on the players that I would like to see feature this weekend, Alex Buttner in particular, but I will save it for later. RVP's injury occupies my mind and full attention currently as we eagerly await further news on his condition sometime soon. Keeping my fingers crossed X

Till next time...........................................
