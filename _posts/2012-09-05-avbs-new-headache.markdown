What a change an year makes. Exactly one year or so ago, Andre Vilas Boas was the toast of Europe. A brilliant young manager with enterprising and tactically astute football, he was the next in line to the special one's throne and Roman Abramovich saw so too and thus appointed the disc man as the new manager at Stamford Bridge to usher in a new year at the club. We all know what happened next and how everything panned out over the course of the next 12 months and the huge beating that Vilas Boas's reputation took for his abysmal showing as a Chelsea manager.

He should have learnt from his mistakes, and I am personally backing him on that front, I am sure he certainly did. His man management issues, ie. his very poor handling of players at Stamford Bridge had played a huge part in his sacking. His handling of the senior players at the club was heavily critcized, unhappy players barely ready to break a sweat for their manager let alone go through a wall for him made sure he got the boot in February and we know how the change transpired the reversal in the club's fortunes.

I have come across some very interesting news in the medis recently, wonder where do these stories get planted from? It has to be the players agents i guess. Quite frankly how can you explain to me the fact that a new goalkeeper who hasn't even been at the club for a week let alone played a game is causing dissent because of the comments that his manager made at the weekend over the performance of his other goalkeeper. Brad Friedel had a sensational game against Norwich and was the sole reason why Spurs won a point, so praise from a manager was natural and to keep his new palyer on his toes and to also keep Friedel motivated he made a comment that any manager would have, I can see Sir Alex also making a similar comment if he had been in that situation. But what changes the matter altogether is that No National manager, not even a Didier Deschamps would have dared criticze or comment on the quotes of Sir Alex from a post match interview. But AVB is not in a position as Sir Alex is and nor does he enjoy the universal respect or possess the wisdomÂ  that Sir Alex has. And thus a small motivational quote that was made to keep both lads on their toes for the better of the club has quite frankly boiled into a pointless mini-saga between the French national team manager and Tottenham Hotspur Football club.

I personally did not see Hugo Lloris starting the game last weekend, manager probably realised that he had a long week and needed a bedding in period, so he kept him off the firing line just as he did with Clint Dempsey(Pardon me if i have missed something, I am not sure whether Clint was registered in time to play or not). What he did not envisage was the decision to so badly backfire on him because of a comment he gave in one of post match interviews and thus snowball into a saga. But the manager will ride through the storm. I personally feel AVB is much better off than last year with greater experience and also has the quality of being willing enough to learn from his mistakes. I for one want to see Spurs flourish under his reign.

Till next time............................................................
