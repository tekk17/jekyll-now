I have to admit it was quite a long saturday and sunday evening for me, with no club football being played it did turn to out to be a quite drab weekend. But there was international football going on, Friday night saw the FIFA 2014 world cup qualifiers kicked off. Some teams did well, others were just present there to make up the numbers and the top teams were just going through their motions.

First Netherlands, how they managed to win for me is a mystery, the Turks, were by far the better team on the night. Them not getting a sinlge point let alone winning the game outright was a big tragedy in itself. France were impressive enough, Diaby in particular caught the eye. Italy on the other hand were abysmal and did well to win a point away from home in Belarus. England won too, and its quite strange with the kind of treatment the team always gets from the press. When was the last time this team was really appreciated for their performance. I need to hark back to those back-back victories against Croatia on the way to their 2010 WC Qualifying, when they did produce some of their best football under Fabio Capello. But after that , nothing! Not even the 1-0 win overÂ  Spain last year at Wembley was taken positively. Well the three lions will face a much sterner test come this Tuesday when they meet a young inexperienced side in Ukraine at the Wembley, who will test them more. Expect Carrick to start as Roy will look to start with a win in his first official home game.

There was not all football blankout this weekend. NPower League 1 and 2 did go through and there were quite a few enjoyable moments here and there, which i liked watching as part of the The Football League Show, quite a good show that is. Swindon's second defeat in a row is the only news regarding the show that I can recount at the time of writing. Well, its only two more days to go before the lads report back to their clubs and we can have our season back and running in full flow without any interruptions of these international qualifiers coming in way.

Till next time.......................................................
