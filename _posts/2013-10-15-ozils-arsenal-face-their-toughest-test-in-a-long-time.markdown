Mesut Ozil’s move to Arsenal has been well documented and publicized for the best part of more than a month now, one thing that cannot be denied is the impact it has had on his new team’s results and fortunes.

I have a fetish for left footed playmakers, I really like them a lot and observe them from close quarters. David Silva, Juan Mata, Shinji Kagawa, I have been in awe of them over the past few seasons. I also liked the look of Mesut Ozil a lot and it was such a shame not being able to watch him week in week out as he was playing in La Liga and with their unfavorable time slots, it would be very difficult watching him play. All that changed last month as Arsenal pulled of one of the biggest heists of the century to lure him to the Emirates. And boy has it not worked brilliantly.

He is a sheer delight to watch. The nimble footed footwork, that amazing technique, the appreciation of space, the timing of his runs, the effortless ease with which he glides across the grass, I have to admit I have  never seen him run. He floats across the surface with effortless ease akin to a ballet dancer. The caressing of the ball with his left foot, those soft passes onto the feet of the onrushing players, the exquisite skill and those gorgeous assists are the stuff of dreams, I am so much in love with him and his game. 

I read a lot of Zen blogs and it is strongly preached that you do not compare yourself with others and be happy with what you have, but I can’t help myself but look with envy, see him wield his unworldly magic in an Arsenal shirt. He has had an excellent start to life at the Emirates and is yet to lose a game. But now begins the toughest part of the season, a defining six game period where Arsenal will face their toughest run of fixtures, when the squad will be tested to the limit as they will need all their players to be fit, to come through this run unscathed. A Champions league tie against Borussia Dortmund on the 22nd, followed by a derby against Chelsea at the Emirates on the 29th, a visit to Anfield on the 2nd of November, a return trip to Dortmund on the 6th and culminating with a visit to Old Trafford on the 10th.
 
By the time these games come to an end it will be very clear indeed whether Arsenal do possess the steel, fight and depth of championship contenders as the test they face over the coming weeks will be one of the toughest they have undergone in a long time. The limelight will surely be on them, after the kind of results they have had, unbeaten in 11; no wonder the expectations are high and big things are being expected of them. Come November 11, the picture will take shape as to how their season moulds into the winter months.
 
Exciting times for Gooners.

Till next time……………………………………
