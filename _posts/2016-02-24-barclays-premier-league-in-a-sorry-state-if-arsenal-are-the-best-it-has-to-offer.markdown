![Arsenal]({{ site.url }}/images/Arsenal_Barca.jpeg)

Let’s look behind the plaudits and the deserving platitudes that are being showered on Barcelona at the moment. Taking no credit away from them, they were ruthless at crucial moments and displayed a streetwise cunning to their game as they clinically dismantled Arsenal last night.

And they did not even need to change to a higher gear to do that. Arsenal displayed good defensive acumen for the first 70 minutes, they were very good in the first half and then threatened in the second for the first 20 minutes, but it was all apparent that they would be vulnerable to the kind of sucker punch that they got hit with once they decided to lower their defence and try to trade some blows themselves.

Barcelona are a different kind of a beast these days, gone are the days when they would drive teams into submission by sheer the intensity with which they kept the ball during the Guardiola days. This team has the look of Luis Enrique stamped on it. The old ethos of ball retention and pressing high up the pitch are retained, but Barca now also have a plan B to them something which they did not earlier.

They are now equally content to sit back , come to think of it, they seemingly invite teams, taunt them, falsely luring them into landing a blow, and then just like Floyd Mayweather, they duck that punch and land a counter punch in a thrilling flash. 16 seconds was all it took for Catalans to counter from Arsenal’s box to Messi scoring with the first real chance he had all night.

That fact is telling, the quality of the forwards that Barcelona have, you know one chance was all that is needed for them to stamp their authority over the opposition and they did this without having had to raise their game. It seemed as if they were on autopilot.

Having realized Arsenal stacked numbers in midfield with not much space for their forwards to run inside, Barca did more of the same and seemingly cancelled out Arsenal’s threat themselves, expertly frustrating Sanchez as he did not get to see much of the ball. Arsenal for their part had some chances, from which they were unable to profit. They were lackadaisical, while they did brilliantly in limiting the clear cut chances Barca had, they failed to take adavantage of some of the ones they managed to carve out.

And that there was the big different between the teams, the lack of star quality up front, someone you know will take that one chance and turn an half opportunity into a goal. Arsenal clearly lacked that and thus ended up short against the best Spain and Europe has to offer this season.

This is a damning indictment on the quality of the Barclays Premier League, if this is the best that it can offer against the European elite. A team that stands a chance of winning its first title in 12 years, was swept aside with impunity by a Barcelona team that did not have to change from second gear all night. 16 seconds of a flash was all it took to sum up Arsenal and their defensive naivety that has been laid bare by many teams over the years.

While the Gunners performance defensively for me was even better than that fantasy night from February 2011(when they triumphed 2-1) they quite simply had no answer to the extra string in the bow of a street-wise counter-attacking Barca.

And while we gaze dreamily at the level of technical football Barca could summon on the night, English clubs need to have a good hard look at themslves over why they have been faltering at this familiar stage for quite some time now.

The defensive intensity, tight midfield shape and compact orgainisation, the ethos on which English clubs used to base their continental success on are gone. The lightning fast counter-attacks something that English clubs used to specialize on don’t seem to be in vogue anymore. Atleast in Europe at the moment; It was if they were lulled by Span and Barcelona’s (2011) success into believing that passing the ball around and working through the gaps into the box was the only way to win it in Europe.

This has been a transition period for the clubs with the big boys in various stages of regeneration and it will take them sometime to get that streetwise nous of playing ugly and winning on the counter back.

I am not going to lose my sleep over it though because I am busy enjoying the brilliance that Bayern, Barcelona and Juventus have been serving up on European nights.

Till next time……………………………….
