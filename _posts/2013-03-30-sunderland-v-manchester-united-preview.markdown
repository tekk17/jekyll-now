I have had thoughts about reviving this blog for quite a while now. The dwindling viewership which was one of the biggest factors in the discontinuation of this blog still exists but I have this huge urge at times, those extreme moments of joy and despair that you want to share someone with and at that time I remember this blog, about how I used to regularly update it for close to 4 months at the end of last year. 
To be precise, its been almost 3 months since I wrote something meaningful here, a lot of water has flown down the river since. There has been a lot of joy with the right mix of sorrow thrown in. A 15 point lead at the top of the table has been a source of joy and it swells me with pride everytime I look at it.
On the other hand we got knocked out of Europe by a Real Madrid side that was admittedly better than us at crucial stages of the game. Following that game we suffered another disappointment at home again as Chelsea rose back from the dead to draw 2-2 to setup a tantalising game at Stamford Bridge on monday, a game which they will have an upper hand on for sure as we have struggled historically over the years there. But come to think of it we haven't  lost at the Bridge since February 2011, so there are signs of optimism for sure. 
Today, we make the trip to the Stadium of Light-Sunderland, the scene of epic disappointment last year as we saw Manchester City take away the title from our grasp, the jubilant scenes of Wearside supporters performing the poznan added to the pain; the feeling of quite how we allowed them to wrestle back the title after holding an 8 point lead with 6 games to go. It was an un-Manchester United thing to do, A feeling that still gives me nightmares at times. 
Coming to the game, with Sunderland in relegation trouble, Steven Fletcher and Lee Cattermole out for the season, things are extremely gloomy at the Stadium of Light but one thing Martin O'Neill's side will make sure is that the defence wont be breached easily, mark my words it is going to be a very difficult game for us today and scoring will in turn be even more difficult and a draw would be a decent result for us keeping in mind the team that Fergie sends out today with the clash at Stamford Bridge looming large. I would have loved to have said with the game at Galatasaray looming large in midweek but destiny had other things in mind.
Never mind, enjoy the game. 
Till next time.....................
