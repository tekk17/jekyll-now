It's time that we got over the loss at the weekend out of our system, no matter how painful it felt or how hard it hit us; The thing is we take the positives from the game and move on. That is all that we can do about it once the game has been played. Its done and dusted with; Looking at the positives, there were so many to recede my worries that I had about our team. I happened to watch the Newcastle United game from midweek too as I had mentioned earlier, and the passing game of our midfield was very impressive. The best part of it was how comfortable both our centre halves Michael Keane and Scott Wootton were on the ball in that game. We played triangles deep in our own half when pressurized by the magpies players and built the play patiently from the back. I have to admit I am a great lover of aesthetic football and to see that kind of play was a sheer delight. Coming to the second half at Old Trafford, where we again were breathtakingly brilliant, Scholes with his brilliant passes, Rafael with his marauding runs and Kagawa with the superbly taken goal made for a very typical Manchester United performance.

And the best bit was, the biggest plus was, the return of Wayne Rooney. All those who have championing that the lad is on the decline or is not effective anymore or does not fit into United's plans simply don't know anything! He was so instrumental in our revival on Saturday. His presence lifted the players; He came on and grabbed the team by the scruff of their necks and almost won the game for us had it not been for a cross-bar miss from Carrick through a corner or the post miss from that peach of a free-kick from Wazza himself. This is why he is so important to us. It is not only his general play but the overall lift that he brings to the side that is so very important to us. He has the same effect on our team that a Messi has on Barcelona or a Ronaldo has on the Real Madrid team. He is that important. Questioning his ability on the ball after some admittedly poor displays was very impatient and unforgiving of us. In order to vent out our disappointments on another heartbreaking quarter final penalty shootout loss this summer we found the perfect scapegoat in Rooney, when he begun the season in a very tepid fashion with poor fitness. And the injury meant he was out of the limelight for a while and the rumblings just continued. But sooner rather than later when we started getting sluggish in our play and barely managed to scrape through games did we realize the inherent importance Wazza has in the team. It's good that he is back; with some huge games looming on the horizon we could do with his presence.

Coming to the team news for tonight's Match Day 2 game against Cluj in Romania; Carrick, Giggs, and Scholes have not travelled with the group. Carrick and Giggs are out with minor problems like virus and Scholesy although fit was bound to be rested with three games in a week almost too much for a 37 year old. Sounds sensible to me when you know that we will need him badly at St.James park on Sunday, fit and firing on all cylinders if we have to score there. We have failed to score in our last two visits on the tyneside. More on that later in the week though once we wrap up this game.

Cluj will be no pushovers as Sir Alex's comments in his press conference clearly suggested. This is the team that knocked out Basel in the qualifiers and then beat Braga away from home on Match Day 1. It was an accomplished victory. Praising their defensive discipline Sir Alex has admitted that it will be a tough game and warned his side to be wary of the counter attacking game that Cluj specialize in. It is going to be a tough game and we will need proper organisation and a good working system to our play if we have to get some return from our trip to Romania. Playing 11 selection could be interesting for me, Wootton could feature here if Sir Alex feels that three games in a week could be too much for Rio, Fletcher is surely expected to play a part and so is Cleverley and Anderson but the balance of the team and playing 11 is still a mystery to me and I would reserve from making any prediction on this bearing in mind Sir Alex's penchance for rotation. Hope we have a good game.

Till next time...........................................................................................
