![reading]({{ site.url }}/images/article-2242273-164DDC80000005DC-568_634x461.jpeg)

Much has been said and written about the so called thriller that unfolded at the Madejski stadium on Saturday evening and I am not going to repeat those hyperboles to stress upon it anymore. Coming straight to the point, it made for a very worrying watch, seeing the shambles right in front of my eyes. It was all unravelling so swiftly that it took time to sink in; coming to terms with one of the most abysmal defensive performances I have seen by our team in a long long time.

I have been campaigning Jonny Evans’ case for weeks but he let me down big time on Saturday night as one mistake after another lead to a flurry of goals. Rafael another star performer of the season had a torrid time at right back, directly responsible for the first goal, very rash in making challenges and a deserved yellow card saw him rightfully hooked off in half an hour. I was hoping Fergie would rest him for this game. He has been playing non-stop for weeks and knowing the penchance that Fergie has for squad rotation I had thought he would replace Rafael and play Smalling from the start. But our defence has been such that, playing a stable back four game-in game-out made complete sense.

Why does he not adopt the same approach with his goalkeeper. Honestly, I have failed to make any sense what so ever over why he has been juggling them so constantly. David de Gea has not warranted the stint out of the side that he has been undergoing. Quite frankly I would side with David in wondering what on earth has he got to do to become a regular starter, that is get a sequence of games, 10-15 maybe to ensure there is stability at the back. Fergie for all his talk of a stable back four, which he clearly prioritizes above everything else is somehow for some particular reason failing to grasp the important role that a goalkeeper plays in keeping that ball out of the net.

There were clear instances in the game, where Jonny Evans came right in front of Lindegaard,directly in his line of vision to head the ball out, effectively obstructing him. If this is not a sign of defenders lacking trust in their goalkeeper then what is. Lindegaard has not covered himself in much glory here either. All though he has not been shaky altogether, but he has been found short on crucial occasions, a sign that he allows the pressure to get to him. He hardly covered himself in glory during those shambolic 36 minutes at Reading on Saturday.

For me, David de Gea who will be expected to play against CFR Cluj in midweek, which is expected to be a regulation game for him should remain between the sticks against City on Sunday come what may. Fergie has to stop playing around with his goalkeepers. Or on the other hand he has to continue with Anders till the Christmas period and see how he does. Starting the juggle again is only going to increase the mayhem.

With a performance such as this, don’t even think of a clean sheet at the Etihad stadium, coming back with a point will be a huge bonus for us. The return of Nemanja Vidic cannot come soon enough. Cannot believe I actually said that! After all the campaigning I have been doing for Rio and Jonny over the weeks.

Till next time………………………………….
