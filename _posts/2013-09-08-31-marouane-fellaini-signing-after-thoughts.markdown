After whinging for the best part of 3 years, the subdued feeling among fans even after a new central midfielder being signed is unfathomable.

First things first, I completely admit that our transfer window did not go as planned, and I even wrote a rather exaggerating piece on it which you can check it out [here](http://tkalawatia.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/transfer-window-fiasco-review/). Then came a rather appeasing piece from [Daniel Taylor in the guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/04/manchester-united-ander-herrera-transfer-farce) where he beautifully explained how we were double crossed in a game of bluffs and counter bluffs in the game you call “the transfer window”. That piece made sense and led to me to treat all those rather demeaning articles criticizing our dealings in this window as trash. I do partly agree with them to some extent but that won’t mean I agree with them and will go about slandering the name of my club.

Coming to the main point, the Fellaini signing. After all the pessimism that we expressed it is perhaps time to look at the glass as half full rather than half empty. A proper dynamic box-to-box midfielder being signed is certainly good news since we have been crying for one ever since Darren Fletcher fell ill and Hargreaves’ knees gave away. I had been crying for the presence of a dominating presence in the middle of the park for a very long time since last season, a player who could drive us through the centre of the pitch with his sheer presence, grab a game by the scruff of its neck and change things around. Fellaini is for me is a player who could grow into stature of that kind.

A proper midfield dynamo, capable of lung bursting runs and exceptionally good at tackling, he is a type of player that we have been missing for a long time. His tactical side of the game and ability with the ball will only improve among players who are adept at keeping possession for longer periods of the game. Initially it could prove to be very demanding for him to be part of a system that is very good at passing the ball and retaining it. His decision making, ability to spot a quick pass will have to be very good if he has to effectively contribute in the final third of the pitch. I would expect him to start with the middle of the field and feel his way into the scheme of things as the season goes on, what should not be mistaken is that he will for sure bring an increased attacking threat to our team from corners and set-pieces, what should also not be forgotten is that he will also be very effective defending set-pieces too.

For all his critics, there are quite a few including myself to be honest; there are some weaknesses in his game that would have to be ironed out, like his tendency to dwell on the ball in the final third of the pitch sometimes could cost a team like us who prefer passing the ball at pace in that area. On the other hand, while the lad is a true fighter that will endear him to the fans, he has impetuousness in his game which leads to mistimed tackles and frequent bookings. We have had a pretty clean record as far as our red card column is concerned, so he will have to work on those areas, which I am sure he will certainly get better with.

All in all I have the complete confidence that if properly utilized and integrated into the setup, Fellaini has the completely capability to develop into the Yaya Toure of our team. I would stop at going further and comparing him to have an impact that a certain no.16 had on us for all those years, for which we worship him to date no matter what he speaks or has spoken.

Till next time…………………………………
