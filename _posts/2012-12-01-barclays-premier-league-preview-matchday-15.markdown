There may not be any big games proper being played this weekend but the games surely will be riveting if you look at the plots and sub-plots that are involved.

I will begin with the day’s early kickoff at Upton Park with another London derby as West Ham United square up against Chelsea. West Ham who had been on a roll since the start of the season owing to a generous fixture list will be under pressure as they look for their first win since back-to-back defeats against Spurs and Manchester United away from home. That will be the one comfort the hammers will try to exploit today as they look stem the rot with a good performance against the Blues. Chelsea look like a team in crisis at the moment as the change of a manager has not galvanised the team in a manner that everyone would have hoped. Fernando Torres’ form is still in the dumps; the team has not scored in the past two games under Rafa Benitez and has not looked close to scoring either. It is now 4 out an 18 possible points for Chelsea and should this continue then their title chances could be well written off even before Christmas as the gap between the two Manchester clubs and the others just keeps on widening. Benitez is under pressure to deliver here but an away game might just be the thing that the doctor ordered to get away from the baptism of fire he has faced at Stamford Bridge in the past two games. Make no two ways about it Chelsea need to win this game to stem the rot that just does not seem to stop at the moment. Coming to the other side of the pitch the focus will also be on the hammers fans at the end of what has been a very shameful week for English club football where the anti-Semitic chants have dominated the game and the hammers fans have been criticised left right and centre. It is time they stood up and showed the world why they are fans one of the truly great clubs in the English game.

Arsenal face Swansea in the one of the several of today’s afternoon kickoffs as two sides with brilliant passing games come together for an exhibition of football. I had said the same thing last week too as Liverpool faced the Swans at the Liberty, which turned out to be a very drab piece of encounter. Arsenal who will be expected to win this one have not shown the fluency that could be expected for a side of the ambitions that they have. Virtually out of the title race already come December, Arsene Wenger is under no illusion about the growing discontent among the club supporters and badly needs a winning run going along with a few signings come January to bring back the supporters on his side again. Swans have been flying at the moment having been unbeaten in 5 and collected 9 out of possible 15, that huge slump in form in September looks like history now. A perfect example of how international break can arrive at just right time to cause a reversal of fortunes as Michael Laudrup showed excellent knowledge and used his wisdom to open himself to the team, be more receptive to their ideas and bring back the team on the right track.

Having been unbeaten at home since December 2010 when a David Moyes led Everton side beat them 2-1, Manchester City face their arch nemesis again as the two teams face off tonight with Mancini and Moyes going head to head to revive a frosty relationship at best that has always threatened to explode. City who should be credited for being in the top two without looking not even half as convincing as their manager would have liked, have started to get their act together of late. Having struggled all season defensively as their manager has been crying out for solidity time and again, they have started getting their act together by keeping an impressive 5 clean sheets in the last 6 games and collecting 14 out of the last 18. Everton on the other hand have slowed up a bit after the thundering start that they had to season and have only one win to show in their last 6. But the toffees have always produced their best when facing the Champions and will certainly bring their A-game to the Etihad as City face one of their biggest tests at home this season. Everton have an amazing head-to –head record as they have won 8 out of their past 10 meetings. Quite incredulous isn’t it!

Coming to our game now, Manchester United travel to play Reading at the Madejski Stadium in the days late kickoff. Having won 5 out of the last 6 with no draws to show the Red Devils have shown the characteristic knack of winning when not playing at their best in recent games, especially when we overcame first QPR then West Ham at home in the last two games. Reading will be no easy pickings either, Sir Alex praised the work that Brian McDermott has done at the Madejski and predicted it to be a tough encounter almost as difficult as the game at Norwich where we got soundly beaten.  Coming to the team news, Valencia is not going to make the trip, Nani will be out for a month, talk of injured wingers I tell you; Ashley young is fit and will be expected to play a part. Rio Ferdinand having been rested in midweek is expected to return to the team to slot alongside Jonny Evans in defence. Paul Scholes will also be available after serving a suspension in midweek. The biggest news has been the return of skipper Nemanja Vidic to full training and he is expected to start against CFR Cluj in the Champions League encounter in midweek at home. Apart from this there’s no big news although the boss did worry about Wayne’s goal scoring form having seen him find the net just 3 times in 14 appearances this season.

In other of today’s games, Fulham face Spurs at Craven Cottage, Southampton make the trip to Anfield to face Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion face off against the Potters at the Hawthorns and Aston Villa play QPR at Loftus Road as Harry Redknapp looks for his first win as the Rangers’ new manager.

In tomorrow’s encounters, Norwich travel to Sunderland to face a Martin O’Neill side that is under huge pressure with their manager facing one of his biggest challenges in an illustrious career, elsewhere Newcastle United will look to come out of their huge slump in form as they face Wigan at St.James’ Park on Tyneside.

Enjoy your games for the weekend. I will be back tomorrow with my customary review of our game.

Till next time………………………………………..
