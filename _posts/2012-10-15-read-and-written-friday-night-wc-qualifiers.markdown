Hi there! It’s been a long time since I last wrote a post. And I have been thinking ever since for a suitable topic to come up with, to comment on what is going on currently in my football world at the moment. With the international football going on, the club football has gone rather quiet; Therefore the lack of ideas. But there were Friday night World Cup qualifiers that were played and some very interesting things popped out of these.

I watched the highlights of quite a few games, some things caught my eye. The Armenia v Italy game was quite open, especially if you conform to the Italian standards. Italy were run ragged by those Armenians and were carved open quite easily very frequently. The Armenian attacking midfielder Henrik Mkhitaryan really caught my eye. Quite a player that boy is. All of 23 years old, he is hailed as the brightest player to ever emerge from the country and they have pinned huge hopes on him. And going by the form of the lad for his club Shakhtar Donetsk where he is setting the ground on fire, the hype is surely justified. I mean, you need to see it to really believe it. He has got an eye for a pass, lifts his head up and can sprint past a player with consummate ease, something that Bonucci could surely testify to.

In another game, Belarus v Spain, Spain were their typical self as they passed Belarus to shreds en route to a regulation 4-0 victory away in Minsk, it looked so easy at times you know. The way they passed around the Belarusians was breathtaking at times, next they face France at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday. Serbia v Belgium in Belgrade promised to be a tight affair, with all the talk of the golden generation of Belgium and the wonderful wealth of players they possess the pressure was surely on them to produce the result and by god they did not disappoint. They took the lead and then simply tore Serbia to shreds through breathtaking counter attacks. The Kevin de Bruyne goal was brilliant. It makes me wonder why the boy was farmed out on loan when he possesses obvious quality, sometimes I fail to find any sense with functioning of the club that is Chelsea.

England played too you know. Beat the favourite whip boys San Marino 5-0 at Wembley with Rooney and Welbeck scoring twice and Oxlade Chamberlain completing the riot with a first goal for his country. Talking point for me was the interesting move by Hodgson to hand over the armband to Wayne. That is a very shrewd move if you ask me. Entrusting the lad with the responsibility could finally be the making of him on the international stage. Hodgson quite clearly declared that he will be the next in line to the captaincy when Gerrard calls it a day or is unavailable. Hopefully the added responsibility will knock some more sense into him and could be the making of him in international football. I for one don’t want to say that 2004 was the best we saw of Wazza in an England shirt. That’s all for now, more thoughts after tomorrow night’s qualifiers after which we get back into our groove as the premiership truly kicks off with no break till late February.

Till next time…………………………………………….
