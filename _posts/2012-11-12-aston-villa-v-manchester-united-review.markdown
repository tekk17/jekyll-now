What a game it was on Saturday evening. We came back from 2-0 down to win it 3-2 with Chicharito Hernandez scoring a brilliant Ron Vlaar aided hat-trick. It was a great sight to see us score three goals away from home against a team that has been very tight at the back of late. Ron Vlaar led Villa defence has been magnificent in the last few games and us scoring three goals against them was a very good thing.

Coming to the game, first things first; hats off to Aston Villa for playing very well and making a great game of it. They played with great verve, and energy to go 2-0 up before we stepped up a gear to outgun them. The goals that they scored were well taken. And that period up to the 57th min they were by far the better team and the two goal lead was well deserved.

Christian Benteke played well up front, lead the line admirably by running the channels, holding the ball up and drawing defenders out of position. It was a similar run that he made on the left and took Smalling with him, collected the ball, outmuscled Chris and set-up Weimann for a powerful finish that De Gea could do nothing about. For the second goal, it was good passing from the Villans in the final third, but we could have done better with it if you ask me. Ireland pass to Weimann easily bypasses Rafael and Rafael should have read that, Mistakes like these cost you dear.

Rafael who has been sensational for us this term can be a little susceptible at the back and his failure to read Ireland’s obvious pass led to the goal. I might be being very harsh on him but I expect so much better from him. This part of his game, reading and understanding the play and anticipating the next pass and intercepting it needs to be honed, this will lead to him make that transition from a good to a great player. Playing in the Champions league will improve him as a player and I see him develop into a world class right back in the years to come.

Our goals were very well taken, Scholesy gave another midfield masterclass, and what a pass! What a pass it was to setup Hernandez for the first. Conjuring something out of nothing is Scholesy’s specialty and he did it again to bring us back in the game. The second goal from a cross by Rafael scored by Hernanadez was equally well taken albeit aided by Ron Vlaar deflection. And the third goal from a very good RVP free kick that Hernandez headed into the net rounded off a perfect 30 minutes where we had been brilliant.

Hernandez has been sensational for us again this season and has found that knack of scoring again. His constant movement and change of pace leaves a centre half knackered and add Robin into the equation and you are asking too much from a back-line of any standard team and I haven’t even mentioned Wazza yet. It was RVP’s free kick that led to the winning goal for us, what a difference he has made to the side. I have to admit I had doubts about him when we signed him; whether we really needed him as such but the positive impact that he has had; the lift he has given us and the difference he makes to the side is priceless. We could have easily come away with a draw from the game a season ago but Robin made sure that we won it. Another typical case of Fergie knows best.

The best part of the victory was the fact that we came from 2-0 down to win it. The spirit and the determination that we showed to win the game from that position is the reason we have been feared over the years and it this spirit that typifies Manchester United. Scholesy’s performance in the centre of the park was priceless and a collector’s edition for me. With winter already there, bring on the games, let a winning streak roll, that target of 100 goals for the season looks ever so realistic with each passing week.

Till next time…………………………………………..
