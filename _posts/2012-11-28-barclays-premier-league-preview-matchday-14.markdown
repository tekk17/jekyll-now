You know winter is here when the afternoon kickoffs are played in bright floodlights and a yellow ball glides along the green frosty surface. Another characteristic of wintery nights are the midweek Premiership games. Starting yesterday, Barclays premier league had its first midweek matchday with Reading being beaten at Aston Villa 1-0 and Sunderland playing out a 0-0 draw at home to Queens Park Rangers.

Tonight, Manchester United play West Ham United at Old Trafford, on the back of a 3-1 win against QPR from the weekend. Anderson who turned the last game on its head by his drive and surging runs from midfield will start tonight. I would like to see a calmer presence alongside him in midfield and with Carrick back after a rest he is expected to start alongside him. Anderson’s revival has been making news in the media and experts are finally beginning to ponder whether he has finally come of age. Well, speaking as a fan I would not like to jump the gun as I have been frequently disappointed by him over the years to get enamored by this latest of revival in form he has shown. He will have to do it on a consistent basis starting tonight for at least 10 games until February so that he stands firmly in Fergie’s plans for the Champions League encounters that follow.

West ham United will be no easy opponents and it will be a tough night for our centre halves especially with Andy Carroll returning to scoring ways with a goal at White Hart Lane on Sunday. The defence is expected to face a stern test physically. The main area of concern for me has been our weakness in defending set-pieces. We have been found out in setplays on quite a few occasions this season. And we will face a stern test in this department tonight. Countering their threat from the wings will also be equally important.

Phil Jones who has been fit could well play a part in this game. Rafael has played non-stop for a long time now and he could be rested either tonight or for the weekend.

In other games, one that catches the eye will be the Spurs v Liverpool clash at White Hart Lane. Spurs buoyed by a return to form against Hammers will face a Liverpool side who have been on a good run themselves having been unbeaten in the last 6. The game is expected to be a tight encounter; Liverpool who have tightened up their defence of late have become quite hard to beat, on the other hand Spurs have found it hard to score goals at home. So this game has the potential to be a tight cagey affair.

In other games Chelsea face Fulham at Stamford Bridge; the Blues will be looking for their first win in 5 having collected 3 points from the last 15. Stoke play a struggling Newcastle side, while a resurgent Southampton entertain Chris Hughton’s Norwich at the St.Mary’s Stadium. Swansea play 3rd placed West Bromwich Albion at the Liberty Stadium and to round it off Wigan host the champions Manchester City at the DW.

Enjoy the games. I will be back with a review of the West Ham game.

Till next time……………………………………………
