We are on our journey to the St.Mary's Southampton for our second away game of the season. After being bulldozed into submission by a strong Everton side at the Goodison Park on MatchWeek 1, we are still looking for our first away win of the season. Southampton on the other hand have begun admirably but have no points to show for their fearless endeavours. Their brave counter attacking football at the Etihad on MatchWeek 1 was very good, although they did run out of steam later on and will need to be much more tighter defensively if they need to stay in the premiership.

Ali AL Habsi was the sole reason why they were unable to gain even a point against Roberto Martinez's Wigan at their first home game last week. It is very clear here that the Saints will be no pushovers and will certainly be up for it when the Red Devils come visiting this Sunday noon. I expect the club to be galvanised and put up a show for their fans when a team of Manchester United's stature come visiting. We very well know they are very good going forward and surely capable of scoring goals, but how well will their defence hold up will be the most crucial part. Keeping a front quartet of Kagawa, Young,Valencia and Van Persie quiet for the full 90 minutes could well be beyond them personally.

Manchester United still need some things to sort out of themselves. It will be a relief if Jonny Evans takes his rightful place alongside Vidic at the heart of defence. For me His performances last season have certainly merited him to be played alongside Vidic ahead of a fit-again Rio Ferdinand. He was one of the bright spots of our team last term. Carrick coming back in the midfield will make for an interesting conundrum over who will actually partner him in the centre of the park. I would love to see Cleverley being deployed there and the balance that it would give to the side. Carrick holding the anchor as Cleverley supports the front quartet in a new look Man United 4-2-3-1 will be very exciting to see. I certanily hope it happens . I have been waiting a long while for this midfield partnership to feature and this could well be the weekend when we see it. Otherwise I can wait!

I am expecting a Manchester United win for the weekend with the defensive crisis soothing up a bit with return of the very important Jonny Evans.

Till Next Time.......................
