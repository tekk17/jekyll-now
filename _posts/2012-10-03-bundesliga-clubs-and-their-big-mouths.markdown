Champions League group stages are in full swing and there is a mouthwatering clash tonight at the Etihad as English Champions Manchester City take on the reigning German Champions Borussia Dortmund. This promises to be a great game but I frankly don’t see BVB coming back with any spoils here. But this is not the matter I want to talk about right now, what I want to talk about is the apparent level of pigheadedness that these so called CEOs or whatever they are of these German clubs go on with their business.

Rewind back the clock a year and Bayern Munich were drawn with City in the group stages and then Karl Heinz Rummenigge made some comments about the financial power of the Etihad outfit and how they had sprung up into the top echelons of the game by using Sheik Mansour’s millions. Just because he prides himself on how well he runs his club and the good finances that his club boasts about, that does not give him the right to go on making comments about City’s financial prowess or their backer. This same Rummenigge was seen, earlier that summer doing business with City over the transfer of the highly over-rated Jerome Boateng. Needless to say City had dug their heels in and made sure they got worth every penny that they had fruitlessly invested in the player much to the annoyance of Bayern who had expected to do some easy business. Talk about a case of sour grapes if you ask me. This trend of CEOs or Executives or frankly whatever they are[I don’t care!] making bold comments[sometimes outrageous] but always senseless ones is new to English football and I never come across these from anyone in the premiership but there in the Bundesliga culture, It is all part of the baiting, banter; there the clubs and their execs go about on a war of words making snide comments against their counterparts, quite frankly making a fool of themselves in the process.

And this is what has happened here, Dortmund are to visit the Etihad tonight for a very exciting game and so what does the chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke do? Yes you guessed it right, he makes a rather outlandish comment on having City thrown out of the Champions League, and why? Because, they are spending money from a benefactor who also happens to be the owner of the club. Well, he chose to forget the latter part though. What he has also rather forgotten is that Dortmund used to do the same and went oh so very close to going bankrupt in the early 2000s and had to be rescued by none other than Bayern Munich; Both clubs might fail to acknowledge this as of today, unsurprisingly though for various reason of course! So what I say is Mr Watzke, first look within your own house before making comments about others. And as far as your remarks about City are concerned, I certainly don’t care. Because here in English Football, this culture of atleast CEOs[managers not included, mind you] baiting each other doesn’t exist and thus you may be a guest here tonight but will depart by leaving a very bad taste in our mouths. Don’t expect warm hospitality from your opponents of tonight either!

Till next time…………………………………………………………………………………………
