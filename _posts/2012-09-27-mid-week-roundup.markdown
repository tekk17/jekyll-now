As we enter a quite important period starting this Saturday with a home game against Spurs, about which I will be speaking a lot later, I wanted to mention quite a few things that have happened this week, some of which have been quite good and others have been really very bad.

First, To start with the bad ones, our Captain and talisman Nemanja Vidic will be out for up to two months and thus we will end up missing him for the best part of the Champions League group stages along with the games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs. Well, I was very pessimistic about his chances of playing in every game this season for us as I had a feeling that there would be repercussions from the long injury layoff he had from last year. Coming back from a serious injury is very tough, and there are setbacks on the way as you haven't played for a long time, its usually the hamstrings that bear the brunt of these but it could also turn out to be other niggles or some serious injuries too, its so hard to predict and so very frustrating for the player. Jack Wilshere comes to my mind here, he has gone through a lot since that fateful injury he suffered 14 months ago last July. But, no harm done and hopefully we will have our Captain fit for the important part of the season post Christmas as the games start coming thick and fast.

Our defensive line-up looks very shaky at the moment with only two fit centre halves at the moment. And if you consider the injury record that Rio has had over the past few years, I would not bet on him going unscathed for the best part of the next three months. Jonny Evans has made a successful comeback and was OK at Anfield. Two seasons ago I would have shuddered at the sight of him playing in the heart of our defence but for me he really came leaps and bounds last term to be our first choice centre Half and totally repaid the huge faith Fergie showed in him when he handed him the no.6 jersey. I for one am not worried at all to see Evans in defence alongside Ferdinand. But for me what worries most would be Carrick and Evans playing together when Rio does miss out due to some injury or any other niggle or something, that for me could complicate matters.

Young players from the youth teams i.e. the Under 21s have been showing good promise, especially Wooton, Vermijl and Michael Keane. Michael Keane could end up getting a run in the first team for me this year with the injury record that we have with our defenders, lets see what happens over the coming months. Tunnicliffe made his debut, Cleverley and Anderson scored as we progressed to the fourth round of the Capital One Cup last night with a quite average performance against Newcastle United. It was a fine outing for us given the team that was put out and the defence that played. It held up pretty well and made for a very encouraging viewing I have to admit.

Biggest plus was the return of Wayne Rooney to the team and I will be very interested to see how Fergie manages to integrate him into the playing eleven alongside Kagawa and Van Persie. It will make for a very interesting tactical reading. A very interesting formation could develop here something that Michael Cox had brilliantly pointed out in his early season post on Zonal Marking as he had analyzed our 1-0 defeat against Everton at Goodison Park. With Nani out of form and out of favour, Valencia having a small niggle, team news for this week is still awaited, furthermore the game agianst Spurs will be a tough one as they are starting to have a very continental feel to them with their new formation and some very very good new players. What a player Vertonghen is, Just WOW! More on the game in the later posts.

Till next time.......................................................................
