Ballon D’or winner was announced this week and Lionel Messi customarily won the award for the fourth straight year. It was a case of what might have been. Had it been the old practise with the Ballon D’or and the FIFA World Player of the year still active, Iniesta would have won the Ballon D’or hands down as he had been prolific for both club and country last year[quite evident with him winning the UEFA player of the season in August] although not on the same metronomic level as Lionel Messi who would still have won the Ballon D’or. I did like the old system to be honest with the Ballon D’or considered to be a prestigious award being voted by esteemed journalists from France who did know a thing or two about Football rather than some hags from Georgia who for some god forsaken reason voted for Wayne Rooney, for Chrissakes! Iniesta was my personal choice too for the trophy considering the brilliant performances he gave at Euros to steer his team through the groups and then the quarters and semis against some extremely defensive teams who were happy to park the bus and break on the counter.

After the results came out, another interesting thing happened. A detailed list was published on who voted for whom and there were quite a few astonishing choices made across the footballing world as we learnt about them. It was obvious that with this kind of a populist system in place Messi would win the honor hands down but the votes that he accumulated and so did Iniesta and Ronaldo raised quite a few eyebrows, at least they raised mine.

Picture this, Spain Captain and Real Madrid club mate Iker Casillas totally wasted his first place nomination by voting for, hold your breath Sergio Ramos with second place for Ronaldo and third for Iniesta. Ok, I agree that these awards are political after all and there are huge factors that come into play but if Iker did not want to vote for someone from Barcelona in Iniesta then he could have gone for Ronaldo as his first choice, why waste a perfectly good opportunity by voting for Ramos who if I am not wrong did not even make the top 10.

Several things came out into open and the puzzle pieces started to fall into place with the picture ever so clear. It’s obvious isn’t it, the Real Madrid dressing room is divided to the hilt. Now it makes total sense on why Ronaldo was so disappointed with club hierarchy back in late August – September during that infamous “I AM SAD” gate, his learning of the lack of backing from the club through and through after all that he had done over the past season, winning the title and dragging the team through mediocrity at stages in tough games rendered him feeling distraught. There were no voices made from the club then and nor from the players during that period over his endorsal as the nominee for the prestigious accolade. It was only after that famous stand off and the dramatic episode that unfolded did the club swing into action and start making some voices over their support of the Portuguese as the best player of the year.

All this unfolded in front of Mourinho’s eyes as he saw his title winning team crumble into divisive groups with players taking sides and the unity of the team taking a huge hit as one group openly defying the manager at times and we all know which one that was [ 15,10,1 anyone?]. I am not saying that Cristiano is not open to blame; His selfish attitude and egotism have played a huge part here and is one of the main reasons why he is disliked by many on the planet. But not receiving recognition from your own club and not having the backing of your own club captain when you played such a huge part in winning honors over the season is disappointing to say the least. It’s interesting how an individual recognition can play such a huge part in dividing a team so fractiously as Real surrendered a title that they toiled so hard to reclaim from Barca’s grasp for three years in three months. Yes that was all it took for Real as they were out of the title race by November.

To make more sense, Scotland captain and Ronaldo’s former teammate Darren Fletcher voted for him as the best player of last year on the insistence of You Know Who. While this happens CR7 may be secretly wondering over how many Ballon D’or titles he might have won had he stayed in the Red half of Manchester. The way he is still revered in the press by everyone alike inspite of being so severely disliked by everyone it would be unimaginable of the English press to have not launched on a mission every year to make sure that CR7 won.

Till next time………………………………..
