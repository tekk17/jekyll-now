Life could not have got any better for a Swansea fan three weeks ago. Having out-“Arsenal’ed” Arsenal at the Emirates at the end of what had been a comprehensive beating of the Gunners en-route to a 2-0 win, things were looking very rosy for the Swans. Match winning performance by Michu, a game changing performance by Shechter, accomplished performances in the centre of the park by Britton and Ki and a very solid ever improving centre-half partnership of Ashley Williams and Chico played a huge part in the Arsenal demolition three weeks ago. Then came the win over Middlesbrough in the League Cup quarter finals that took them into the semis which catapulted them(the fans) into an altogether different level of ecstasy as the Swans were flying high.

But that was as high as it could get as they have suffered a few setbacks since then. Beaten at home to a Norwich City side that have been flying high themselves over the recent months (but it did come to an end yesterday as they lost to an West Bromwich Albion side at home who themselves have been in a slump of late) and then comprehensively outplayed at White Hart Lane in a 1-0 defeat that did not justify the full extent to which the Spurs side ran them ragged in North London, it’s been 2 defeats in the last two games in the Premiership as they take to the park today noon against a flying Manchester United side that has been in rampant form of late after the theatrical victory in the Manchester Derby a fortnight ago.

Things have been steadily improving for Manchester United over recent weeks, the recent tendency of falling behind and then conveniently using our famed attacking prowess to win games has receded to an extent as we have started taking the initiative right from the get go. Defence has still not managed to string together a run of clean sheets as we have struggled badly in that department so far. The defensive lapses against Sunderland at home, where we looked so jittery in the final 20 minutes when the team virtually fell asleep will be also be a worrying thing. Fergie was quick to emphasize on that point and stressed the importance of concentration and seriousness in the run-in to the New Year which sees us play 4 times in the coming week. A return of 10 points from 12 will be a necessity no matter what.

It was this time last year when the brilliant run of form that we were on through November and mid-December all came to a shuddering halt as we lost back to back games, first at home to bottom of the table Blackburn Rovers and then a very tough away fixture to Newcastle United at the St. James Park. We need to be wary and heed caution from last year that any kind of complacency like that and the six point lead over City could evaporate into thin air by the turn of the year. But the fixture list is not that daunting this time around as we face West Brom on Boxing Day, then Newcastle at home next weekend before going to Wigan on New Year’s Eve. That’s not a very difficult run of fixtures although we did collect a total return of a SINGLE point from the games against the Magpies at home and the Latics away last season. So it is very clear that this won’t be an easy period for us no matter what.

Fergie has revealed that Captain Nemanja Vidic is expected to return to the side today and Shinji Kagawa who has been training with the first team for a while will be expected to play a part. Sir Alex also revealed that he will be rotating his strikers and that could well see the dream pairing of RVP and Rooney rotated as Fergie tries to keep his players fresh and raring to go through the coming games. Danny Welbeck and Chicharito will both be expected to a play prominent part in the coming days and also expect game time for Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.

I personally feel that Fergie will field his full strength side today as it is going to be a very difficult game at the Liberty Stadium against Swans and curb his famed penchance for rotation till the home game against West Brom on Boxing Day. This fixture last season saw us emerge 1-0 winners at the end of a very tight game, it was a close run thing and the Swans could easily have earned a point that evening.

All in all, it should be a good game today with quality football on view. Our defensive discipline will be called into question and the role of central midfielders and the wingers will be very important as they will have to be very vigilant in tracking the runs of their counterparts into the penalty area. Swansea are well known for their effective use of full backs as most notably Angel Rangel uses it to very good effect to put decent balls into the box or even combine with their attackers deep into the penalty area. Equally the central midfielders arrive late into the penalty box and pass the ball neatly around as they look to play through the opposition’s defence. It will be a stern test for us today which will be enjoyable to watch.

Enjoy the game.

Till next time…………………………………………….
