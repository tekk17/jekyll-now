Three points wrapped up after a cold clinical display at the Stadium of Light saw us emerge 1-0 winners at the end of what was a rather underwhelming game from both sides. Sunderland who have been reeling in recent weeks, bereft of motivation, imagination, energy, drive showed exactly why they are candidates for relegation come May, wheras United on the other hand just got the job done, which has been a tone in recent weeks as we have recorded some rather underwhelming yet clinically effective display that has seen us not concede a goal in over 600 minutes of playing time. 

Impatience is the buzzword for me these days. I am impatient to a huge extent and so are people too for some reason or another. Martin O'neill has been a dead man walking at wearside for some time and Ellis Short's patience finally snapped as he handed him the marching orders yesterday following the insipid defeat. As Simon Bird in the Daily Mirror aptly pointed out that the writing was on the wall ever since he admitted that his side lacked real ability. Now that was a mind game that O'Neill played and it had a counter productive effect than he would have hoped. He would have liked to have seen his side rise to the challenge and prove their manager wrong but it backfired spectacularly as a demoralised squad lost further confidence and they were 11 players terrified of trying something imaginative in front of an hostile home crowd that has seen its patience snap in recent months following a series of dispirited displays where the side has shown no resolve to fight for the cause, add to that the inability to score goals and some dour football on show where they have been better than only stoke in terms of the quality of football being played explains how painful it must have been for the fans in recent months. A new man is set to be appointed swiftly as Sunderland seek to avoid the drop that they should be able to and try to rebuild from there. 

Coming to us, the focus now firmly shifts on the game at Chelsea tomorrow and how we are going to perform. Cup competition has been a kind of Nirvana for the Chelsea side over the years. Failure to perform in the premiership has seen them grow into a consistently well oiled cup side that has a core group of experienced players who know to raise their games for one knock-out encounter every other time that sees them progress through the tournament and win some silverware at the end. Chelsea have literally owned the FA Cup as they have made it an habit of winning it in recent seasons, their progress in the Europa League this term and the Champions League win last season just highlights the huge fact that Chelsea have grown into a well oiled tournament machine, a machine that can rise itself to the occasion for a big game but does not quite have the durability to sustain a challenge over a span of time in a marathon that is the Premiership. A fact that makes for worrying reading, something that makes me believe that we may end up coming empty handed from Stamford Bridge come tomorrow evening. Eager to put on a display for the fans after what has been a rather embarassing performace at the St.Mary's yesterday which culminated in a 2-1 defeat, the players will know that they will be under huge pressure and owe the fans a win and I expect it to come too.

All in all it should be a pulsating cup tie, I hope for a tie that revives the romaticism of the FA Cup that the tournament really needs, us who have been literally screaming for the cup win this season have unduly complicated matters for ourselves and now need to negotiate this tie, something that could see us prolong our wait to get hands on that beauty for some more time.

Enjoy the game.
