These are very tough times for Norwich City. With 6 games played and no win registered yet, they remain the only side not to have won a game this season. Quite a worrying fact that is; In 6 games played, they have conceded 13 and scored only 4 with two of them coming against Liverpool last Saturday when  they were thrashed at home by a rampant Suarez who scored a brilliant hat-trick.

The problem for me here is the defense of the team, 13 goals conceded in 6 games does not make for a good reading. It speaks of relegation form especially when you consider the division that they are playing in. Their defense has hardly been their stronghold; even during the days of Paul Lambert they had the record for allowing the most shots for any team in the division last term. Lambert left for Aston Villa in the summer and was replaced by Chris Hughton. He is a manager who is famed for his management skills; his efficient organization and making the team work as a unit are his biggest plus points. He was the same manager who worked wonders at Birmingham City last season when they juggled the Championship with the Europa League. Yeah, they did play in the Europa League last term, came within a whisker of qualifying to the next stage too, ending up finishing third later. What was more impressive was the way Hughton managed to extract the best out of a small squad as he took them to the Playoffs where they were duly beaten by West Ham. That’s why I was not at all worried or even wince when Norwich announced that Hughton would be managing at Carrow Road this season. In fact I was ecstatic. He deserved a good shot in the premiership after he was acrimoniously sacked by Newcastle in the December of 2010.

Norwich is a very well-run club. It’s got that feeling of the community club where all the fans at the Stadium are the season ticket holders. It’s a feeling of togetherness there. Their appointment of Chris Hughton was a very shrewd move but also spoke volumes about their ambition. Hughton is famous for working on a shoe string budget with mostly limited players, something that his time at Birmingham City testifies for, here he was not given much to spend for this summer either, with some of his main acquisitions being Bassong, on loan from Spurs; Robert Snodgrass from Leeds to name a few. While his immediate rivals at Swansea, Southampton, Reading, QPR splashed the cash as they bought one quality player after another, Norwich on the hand did not do so. This is one criticism that has been leveled at them that there have been too many championship players packed there with limited ability and they are bound to struggle this season with the second season syndrome hitting them hard. But you should not forget that they are working under a new manager who has bought a new philosophy there and it will take time to work and for me the wait will be worth it. Hughton is a very able manager and will make Norwich working even better than under Lambert if given time.

As my afore mentioned stats clearly indicate, it has been a very bad start for the canaries and they are being tipped for the drop this term with their defense very much under scrutiny, same has been the case with fellow strugglers in Swansea who have been woefully inept at defending themselves. The goals that Norwich have shipped have been borne out of uncharacteristically poor errors, due to some very slack play. I expect these mistakes to be ironed out and the manager will surely make this side very tough to beat at home in due time. While as far as tipping them for the drop is concerned I will save my judgment on that till Christmas. I see this team working their socks off for their manager as a unit and be very solid at home something that will be pivotal to their survival in the premiership.

Till next time…………………………………………………………………………
