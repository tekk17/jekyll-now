It was the middle of April, the game against Everton at Old Trafford had come to an end, an exhilarating 4-4 draw, we had just ended up blowing an 8 point lead that we had over City a fortnight ago and would end up duly paying for it by duly relinquishing the title to our bitter rivals. But it was not all doom and gloom for us if you wanted to look at the larger picture. Danny Welbeck on that fateful afternoon had brilliantly combined with Wayne Rooney up front to produce some breathtaking football up front that had bamboozled Everton. The rise of Danny boy had been prolific that season, his ascendancy from the bench to a first team regular being one of the brightest points of last season. Wasn’t it a sight, seeing your very own local lad from the academy make the ascendancy to the first team and play as a first teamer, leading the line and the rightful inheritor of the no.9. We Mancunians were happy indeed.

But somewhere down the line, there was this inherent feeling of disappointment in me, no not for the fact that we had blown lead, I got over it in the next few weeks, it was that feeling of disappointment that you have when you see your personal favourite struggle. A player that you like so much that you want to see him badly do well; I have those too. One is David De Gea and other the very affable Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernandez.

Javier for me me had had a brilliant first season at the club where he scored 20 goals, his impact was so much so that Fergie had apparently got a phone call from Mourinho asking him to name his price for Hernandez, Sir Alex was having none of it and duly got the lad tied down to an improved deal that reflected the blistering start that Javier had had at old Trafford where through that very affable smile of his he had entered in our hearts and become one of the very favourites just like Ole had been for so many years.

But his second season did not pan out the way we wanted to or the way he had hoped. Having played non-stop since the World Cup in 2010, Chicharito then went straight into post season 2011 to play for Mexico in the CONCACAF championships and then to the Libertadores to represent Mexico as the outsider team. After that he suffered concussions in pre-season training, when passed fit he was straight into team at Old Trafford, and although he did start brightly at the Reebok against Bolton scoring two in September, it all went pretty downhill for him after that. Fatigue, and non-stop football saw him tumble from one injury after another and that took a huge toll on him. He looked lost, tired and bereft of that clever movement in and around the box that so symbolised him. Remember those games against Chelsea at old Trafford? First in the CL quarter finals second leg and then in the Premier League, where he made first John terry and then David Luiz look like total mucks. Terry did not have a clue on how to deal with him in those games. That brilliant movement and change of pace, that constant toying with the offside trap had made it a nightmare for the Chelsea defenders to deal with. All those brilliant attributes were nowhere to be seen as he looked totally knackered by Christmas.

He regained some of his lost fitness by the late last season but by that time we had altered our style of play to accommodate Danny boy; by playing balls to the feet of the centre forward more often or hoofing it up a bit for him to hold up the ball to bring others into play that would make use of his abilities better. These were not Javier’s strengths and as a result he struggled to come into the side later on. Goals dried up; He started looking out of place in the team as he stood out for appearing to look like that weak link where the attacks would come and break down. I read many fans forums and it was disappointing to see their impatience and criticism of him and how he was being singled out for some of the attacking impotence that we had been suffering from. To make matters worse, his usual stomping ground of Champions League was not there either last term. Javier for me loves playing on the shoulder of the last defender, constantly toying with their backlines making run in behind them, making a mockery of their offside traps, his perfect sidekick act to Rooney’s playmaking artistry in the 4-4-1-1 was responsible for him scoring goals and with us being eliminated from the Champions League it was all gone and thus he never got enough time on the pitch to score and get the confidence back. Constantly fluffing lines, over running passes and being caught off-side from scoring positions became a common sight from the end of last season.

This summer, there were talks that he could be sold to make way for Danny Welbeck’s development what with RVP being brought but Fergie was having none of it. He had full faith in Chicharito. I still remember that one press conference in the summer where he was speaking for the player, vehemently supporting him just like has always done over the years and one thing stood out. Fergie said “the boy has not had a proper rest in two years, he has been playing non-stop, it has only been this pre-season that he has had some proper rest. Just like at him go this season”.

Fergie got involved with Mexico federation and made sure they took Chicharito off olympic squad and made sure he got due rest in the summer and Hernandez came back looking fresh and energised and as smiling as he had ever been. And off came the goals. He has started scoring again. 8 in his last 6 just shows the kind of red hot form that he is in at the moment. The fan inside me was happy again. That smile and the badge kissing form his celebrations brought back the glee on my face that had been missing for quite a while.

Chicharito was back. And how couldn’t he? We Red Devils after all love our super subs who score winners and equalisers coming from the bench a lot.

Till next time.......................................................
