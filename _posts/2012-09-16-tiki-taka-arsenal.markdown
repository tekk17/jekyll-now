Ok, first things first, Southampton were pathetic, they were a shadow of the team that swept us off the park two weeks ago. Showing defensive naivety, bad luck being struck to all their defenders, they looked a team in sorry state yesterday as they were completely played off the park at the Emirates by a resurgent Arsenal side. Wenger could not have picked an easier game to kick-start the season post international break.

What a performance that was though, I have just finished watching the highlights of the game on Match Of the Day, and I have to admit I am spell bound by some of the football they played. Santi Cazorla is surely the biggest bargain of the season. What a player he is!!! And I thought Cesc Fabregas epitomized Arsenal, well this guy with this style of play and a consistency to match could well transform the Gunners. Watching Cazorla play is better than watching soft porn, its that satisfying and satiating, watching him pull all the tricks from his hat and threading one needle pass after another as he makes a fool of all the players that try to mark him. Podolski was another that caught my eye, a great performance, a brilliant free-kick and the most important thing of all -Â  a natural leader too. You just need to look at his body language and the talk that he gives to other players during the game, constantly encouraging them, giving them an earful whenever needed and leading the attacking from the front. Amy Lawrence was right when she commented that Arsenal are now much more of a team than they were when they had RVP.

I hate to admit it, but RVP ended up making Arsenal better with his departure. A much more complete unit with greatly enhanced attacking artillery, RVP could have thrived in that team scoring bucket loads again this season had he not been misguided by that stupid agent of his. The performance of maturity that Arsenal gave at Anfield two weeks ago could prove to be a watershed moment in their season. And the best part of it all has been Steve Bould, You just need to see it in his pre-match training routines, exercising with the lads as he takes them through their paces, that this guy is a no non-sense fellow. Szczesny might have got a barracking from Bould for that clanger that gifted Southampton a goal.

Things are looking bright this season for the Gunners, with Giroud to start scoring and that resolute defence holding good, I can say to you confidently that this team will break their trophy duck at Emirates this season and do so in style.

Till next time................................................................
