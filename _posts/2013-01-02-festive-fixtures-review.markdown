The festival fixtures have been done and dusted with. I had spoken about the importance of these games in my last post and underlined the return of 10 out of 12 would be a perfect result and so it did. I had felt at that time that the Swansea game would be one where we would draw and so it did turn out but after that we did from OK to pretty well depending on the games we played. While we may have shown some irrepressible spirit in the face of adversity time and again, something that held us in good stead against Newcastle United as we repeatedly came back from being down a total of three times as we stole a 4-3 victory from under their noses right at the end.

The West Brom game was much more sombre, it was a highly fluent technical display, maybe 2 years in the future and with the young side that was fielded, it was a proud performance of beautiful technicality and skill as we outplayed the Baggies at will at times with our fluid movement being too difficult for them to cope and so it turned out. Nemanja Vidic was the main player for us as he helped us keep a clean sheet in the game where we could not find the back of the net and scored only two with RVP netting the decisive blow.

The Wigan game from yesterday was an efficient performance without taking the breadth away or something and it was clinically efficient to the point. We were methodical, did our day’s work and got the result without breaking a sweat; all in a good day’s work.

We take a break from the Premiership this weekend as we romanticise the FA cup which is back with its 3rd round fixtures. We face West Ham United at Upton Park in what will be a very tricky fixture. Going by our record in the previous years when we have stumbled in the semi-finals quite a few times and also lost the final in 2007, Fergie will be looking to win the FA cup this season although it won’t be on top of our priorities for the season obviously.

More on that game later.

A very Happy New Year to all my readers; Thanks for the support over the past year.

Till next time……………………….
