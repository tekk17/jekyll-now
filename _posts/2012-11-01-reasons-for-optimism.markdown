We got knocked out of the league cup last night. I will be lying if I said that I am not disappointed after being eliminated from the League Cup, but this is how things go and you move on. It was a great game and we came seconds away from winning it had it not been for the inexperience shown by the lads. But for now, we are done and dusted with the double header against Chelsea. It’s time we move on from what has been an eventful week to say the least.

Sunday’s game was very positive for us. A lot of the doubts that I have had over the past weeks, months have receded to an extent for the time being. The 4-2-3-1 system that we so effectively deployed at Stamford Bridge was a sign of optimism. Rooney revelled in his role of playing as trequartistia/central attacking midfielder. Him and Cleverley combined effectively in the centre of the field, his bulldozing runs were also a sight to watch. It was a content feeling watching us play for those first 30 minutes that evening, my worries of a lack of drive in midfield, the absence of a driving force in the centre of the park were all erased as I saw Wayne make himself at home in that position. It is going to be quite a sight when he beds in there and makes that centre of the field his own in the years to come. I see him finishing as a CM at the twilight of his career.

The worries that we were being so very easily outrun and torn apart right through the centre of the defence, something that the defeat at the hands of Tottenham had so clearly shown have also been erased to an extent. As long as the manager continues with this brilliantly attacking system of his where Rooney is playing in the thick of the things in the midfield, my worries are gone! I felt so happy and content when I saw that, the sight of him driving our play and pulling the strings from the heart of midfield against Chelsea, it was fabulous.

This new system for me could also solve the Kagawa riddle. Kagawa could feature in the role played by Young on the left. Cutting inside form the by-line and combining with Van Persie and Valencia could be very effective for us. Especially if you look at the way RVP got isolated after the initial 30 minutes of the game, Kagawa could come into the side and provide for the missing link between Robin and a more deeply deployed Wayne. That would be quite a sight. Something that makes me rub my hands in excitement already. Hope Sir Alex persists with the same system against Arsenal this weekend when we face the gunners on Saturday lunchtime at Old Trafford.

Anderson was very influential last night, Fergie has shown remarkable persistence with lad over the years; you have got to hand it to him. The way Ando has let his career spiral downwards after that great start, has made him one of the least popular Red Devils at Stretford end. Anderson has flickered to wither away over the past two years so much so that making a judgement right now over his effectiveness and influence would be premature. I would wait and see how he goes from here.

In other news, much has been documented over the Nani contractual situation, [David McDonnell](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/from-cristiano-ronaldos-replacement-to-manchester-united-1409736) wrote a very good piece in the Mirror documenting the situation and why it is time for the club to cut him loose and why it all makes so much sense. He has been so inconsistent over the past year or so that watching him has been very frustrating. For a lad as talented as him his form has been very inconsistent. Being out of favour on the right with Valencia being preferred over him has not helped his chances either. It’s a bitter end to a career here which promised so much. I still remember the brilliant goal/assist at the Emirates from January 2010 where he tore the Gunners defence apart with breathtaking skill or the brilliant counter attack where he and Wayne so beautifully combined to devastating effect.

Team news to follow over the coming days.

Till next time……………………………..
