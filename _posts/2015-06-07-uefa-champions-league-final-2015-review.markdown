The club football season officially drew to a close last night with the Champions League Final. A quite glorious game between two of the best clubs in Europe this season; while we all knew what would happen as far as the result was concerned, it wasn't as big a foregone conclusion as some believed it would be. On the contrary Juventus showed a lot of grit and determination and for a brief period in the second half also gave an impression that they could steal the game from right under Barcelona's nose but Lionel Messi had other ideas, one sweeping counter attack up-field, a strong shot that Buffon could only parry into the path of an onrushing Suarez who stroked the ball into the net to win the game.

It has been a vintage season for Barcelona, that is beyond doubt; A triumph for attacking football, swift passing and finishing of the highest order from an attacking trident as good as we have ever seen. In a season where we have seen a pragmatist in Jose Mourinho win the Barclays Premier League by shutting the door on the opposition in the second half of the season with his Chelsea side, to see Barcelona win and win with the style they did, clearly showcases the various myriad ways in which football can expressed. Football is art in its purest form and the ways in which it can be expressed makes it all the more beautiful.

Two of the greatest architects in world football, Andrea Pirlo and Xavi Hernanadez graced the same pitch together as players for the last time; the images that they have painted on the field, the teams that they have orchestrated for a generation will forever leave an indelible mark on our minds. The Milan team of the early 2000s, the Pep Guardiola era Barcelona teams, these teams have defined the modern champions league history to the extent that we will reminisce about them, Xavi in particular with a reverence that is reserved for the truly great players.

Barcelona were the best team in Europe this season, period, but they will face new challenges next term from a Bayern Munich team that will rebuild, a more mature Chelsea side, Rafa Benitez's Real Madrid and their opponents from last night in Juventus. I wouldn't go as far as to call this a vintage Chamions League campaign as there were too many repetitive match-ups, I for one am sick of watching Real Madrid against Schalke or Manchester City repeatedly come up short against Barcelona, but there were some standout performances. Real Madrid's performance at Anfield set the tone for the season, then Bayern hammered Roma at the Stadio Olimpico - a thrashing from which they never truly recovered, Bayern again demolishing Porto at home in the quarters to overturn a 3-1 deficit from the first leg, but the tie of the season were the two pulsating encounters between Barcelona and Bayern in the semifinals, and you knew then that the winner for this year's crown would come from that game and so it did. Credit to Juventus though for not appearing timid, meek or submissive against the Catalan onslaught as they battled honorably for so long, they can hold their heads high in the face of defeat as it was against a truly exceptional side that reached new levels of attacking brilliance that has never been seen in a long time.

This season will truly belong to the front three of Barcelona, Senor Messi, Neymar and Suarez.

Till next time............
