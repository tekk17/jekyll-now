So we have our first away win of the season thanks to a brilliant Robin Van Persie hat trick. Quite an eventful game it was last evening. Some poor defending on our side, a missed penalty and finally some last minute drama with the game ending at a now famed scoreline of 3-2. As much as I would like to be happy with our win, there are quite a few things that made for a very unpleasant viewing yesterday. Yeah I know, the pessimist in me is roaring to have a go at everything that was not right about us yesterday, but as early as it is in the season there have been some causes of concern here and there.

Rafael for me has become a typical Brazilian full back, the one who can attack with verve and stamina the whole game but cannot defend for his life. Its the second time in two games straight that he went to sleep at crucial junctures while defending. He has been given the no.2 shirt of Red Nev and I would like to expect better than that for the kind of performances he is being putting in. If only he could add a bit more of a restrain to his defending. It appears that he rushes into his tackles too much. He is too eager to win the ball for me.

Now onto ur next problematic part, our midfield. I will not on and on again about our lack of signings in this area because clearly our manager knows something that I obviously don't and thats why he hasn't signed anyone. It was quite a laboured performance yesterday, well the entire performance of the team as a whole was quite sluggish to say the least. There was not too much running by any of the players, no one wanted to make things happen and it felt like everyone had just turned up to the game thinking that they were going to roll over the Saints without breaking a sweat. Manager sensed this and out came the hair dryer at half time as he sent the team back early for the kickoff for the second half. Credit to the saints for getting stuck in and making it hard for us. It was their first huge game of the season at home and the kind of performance they gave would have made their fans proud, credit to Lambert, Lallana and Co for this.

Our performance in the second half improved but there was a period midway through the second half in the sixties when Southampton could easily have gained a 3-1 cushion but as fate would have it they gave away a penalty the very next momennt which Van Persie quite famously missed. Paul Scholes came on and so did Hernandez. Chicharito's pace did rattle the defence a bit but it was the Scholes substitution that proved to be decisive. Manager knowing that the saints were sitting deep and narrow brought him on to spread play and he did beautifully to pass it ot the wings with those trademark hollywood passes. Some good crosses, sloppy play due to fatigue followed and thus came the goals by the Van the RED and thus we won.

Till next time.......................................
