![PSV]({{ site.url }}/images/2c3c828000000578-3235080-image-a-51_1442309956291.jpeg)

We are making a return to the Champions league tonight as we play PSCV Eindhoven at the Phillips arena. Coming on the back of a comprehensive victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford which we won 3-1, the mood around the club and among the fans in particular is fairly optimistic. After a sabbatical of a year from the big cup it feels good to be back playing among the big teams with genuine excitement in anticipation of big European ties at old Trafford.

In team news, Wayne Rooney expectedly misses out with a hamstring problem, Phil Jones is still some time away from returning to full fitness; all in all the outlook seems pretty bright at the moment in terms of the playing staff.

Memphis makes a return to his home club and it will be interesting to see how he fares there given that he knows the team and their style of play. PSV are arriving into this match on the back of a 6-0 shellacking of Cambuur. Their manager Philip Cocu has done a brilliant job since taking over and they were runaway winners in the last year’s Eredivisie campaign.

United for me look more suited to European football playing a brand of possession football under a manager that knows this competition inside out. I expect us to do well this year with at least making the quarter finals.

Hope we have a good campaign.

Till next time……….
