Hi there, weekend is upon us and I thought of bringing you the brief previews of some important games from the weekend apart from the customary Manchester United game that I do every Saturday or so. So let’s begin with the day’s early kickoff from North London at the Emirates, yes the eagerly anticipated North London derby.

Spurs make the trip to Emirates to face the Gunners on the back of some wobbly form as they have failed to register a point from their previous two outings. Defeat at the hands of Wigan at the Lane and then loss at Etihad to the Champions has seemingly brought an end to the goodwill run that AVB was onto. On the other hand Gunners form has been nothing short of catastrophic since the resumption of the international break from last month. Defeat at the hands of Norwich, Schalke, Manchester United and an abysmal draw against Fulham at home has brought about a serious discontent among the fans who have become disillusioned with the current form of the team. The only bright spot has been the form of hitman Olivier Giroud who has found the net 6 times in his last 8 outings. The scene of that effervescent 3-1 triumph at Upton Park now looking a distant memory, the Gunners will be under great pressure than ever to win at home against Spurs. AVB’s Tottenham have tried to look solid but in the process have lost the attacking vibrancy that they had under Harry Redknapp. With the absence of Dembele it is very hard to see from where the creative spark is going to come from.  The game will be very tight with Arsenal edging this for me.

Chelsea away to West Bromwich Albion will be a tough test for Di Matteo’s boys as winning at Hawthorns will be extremely difficult with the kind of start that the Baggies have made this season. Chelsea’s form has been disappointing with tepid draws at Swansea and home to Liverpool. The form of Fernando Torres has been poor and the chances of him regaining that old form of his look dim. On the other side Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku has been setting the midlands on fire with some magnificent displays, aptly reminding the blues of what they have been missing. This was the game that had marked the end of AVB’s tenure at the Bridge on that fateful evening in February, Roberto might not be in that precarious position but anything less than a win and Chelsea could fall further away from the pack. But in hindsight with the kind of form the Baggies are in at the moment, a draw would not be a bad result for Chelsea while a victory would roar them back on track.

Manchester United make the trip to Norwich City in the day’s late kickoff on the back of a strong win against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Wayne Rooney will be missing through injury but RVP is expected to be fit for the game. Jonny Evans remains doubtful but with Chris Smalling fit it should not be much of a problem. Chris is being eased back but had to face a baptism of fire by Christian Benteke who gave him a torrid time at Villa Park last week. Fergie was apt when he commented that United needed to toughen up and stop shipping those shabby goals at the start. Smalling who has been out for a while was bullied by Benteke in that game; But his physical side of the game will improve in time. I still remember how effectively he had dealt with Dzeko in the Manchester derby in 2011 when he was thrusted into the limelight big time following injury to Rio Ferdinand. He had come out of it with flying colours that day. The team is expected to remain more of the same expect for the absence of Wazza. Jones has been training with the team which is good news for us and is expected to play a part in the Champions league game against Galatasaray in midweek. Norwich is a team that will be very difficult to beat. They have already captured the prized scalp of Arsenal at Carrow Road and would love to add ours to their cap too. Chris Hughton has done a marvellous job stabilising the ship there after the poor start to the season where they had been leaking goals for fun. Having had the time to stamp his imprint on this team he has been able to continue the fine work he did at Birmingham and tighten the defence of the team and thus making them very hard to beat. Offensively Hoolahan’s form has been good and he will be expected to make inroads alongside Pilkington and Snodgrass to supply the evergreen Grant Holt. With the game at Carrow Road, a stadium that has very much of a community ground feel to it and boasting of an atmosphere to match this will be no easy fixture by any strength of the imagination.

In other games, dubbed as the El Sackico, the QPR-Southampton clash at Loftus Road could be a make or break for both the managers. Although the stakes could not be more high for Mark Hughes who is under severe pressure to succeed after a disastrous start to the season. Martin Samuel wrote a [hard-hitting piece in the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-2232541/Mark-Hughes-fight-lose-QPR--Martin-Samuel.html) underlining Hughes precarious position and why it could go so downhill from here if he ends up getting the sack.

Under pressure manager Martin O’Neill takes his side to Craven Cottage to face Fulham on the back of a defeat against Everton where they played some nice attacking football for the first time this season. Fulham who have been on a roll will be very hard to beat at home and with Dimitar Berbatov in fine form this could be a tight game but with Fulham edging it. A Sunderland win here could kick start their season after the dismal run they have been on of 1 win in 20.

So that’s it, enjoy the football and I will be back with review of our game from Carrow Road tomorrow.

Till next time………………………………………………………
