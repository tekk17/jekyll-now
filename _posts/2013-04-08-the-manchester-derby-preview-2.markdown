The kick off is less than 6 hours away now and I can feel the nervous energy in the air. The game that I have been waiting for a very long time is here; The reverse fixture at the Etihad saw us emerge 3-2 winners at the end of what had been a pulsating encounter, while i would love a repeat of that, a draw would not be a bad result for us at all. I will happily take a point form this game going by our form from recent weeks.

At a time when our goal scoring talisman has gone silent at perhaps the most crucial part of the season, the wingers have looked out of sorts for the best part of this campaign I have quite a few worries as we head into the final stretch. With crucial games coming our away beginning tonight, a trip to Britannia to face Stoke followed by tough away games at Upton Park and Emirates which then culminates by a visit from Chelsea in the first week of May, quite a demanding run of games and we will need to be at our resilient best if we have to wrap up the title in the coming weeks. 

Everyone has been proclaiming that United are already home but a defeat tonight could have huge consequences if you look at the demanding run of fixtures we have coming up which gives this game a whole lot of importance than one might think.

Win tonight and the title is as good as wrapped up but loose and this could well turn out to be a very nervous April for us.I still have nightmares from the self destruction we suffered last season although i have to admit this gap is unsurmountable and it is only the big pessimist in me who is looking at such drastic consequences.

Enjoy the game tonight.

Probable Line-Up: [4-2-3-1] De Gea - Rafael:Ferdinand:Vidic:Evra - Jones:Carrick - Cleverley:Kagawa:Rooney - Van Persie

Till next time.....................
