![PSV]({{ site.url }}/images/27f3e4a200000578-3054399-image-a-51_1429899574122.jpeg)

The last few weeks have been a breath of fresh air. After the dire winter months when the form of our team had been so sluggish we have clicked into gear and found form of the highest order at just the right time. I remember feeling pessimistic before Spurs visit, we had been beaten by Arsenal at home in a long time and the last chance of silverware had gone and I had this feeling that we would somehow stumble to the finish line and finish fourth by the skin of our teeth, somehow managing to keep Liverpool behind us. And then Spurs visited, yes it was just Spurs after all, there used to be a time when we could beat them in our sleep until the last couple of years that is, and then 3-0 happened and that first half of football was the best performance we had given all season at home. Then we visited Anfield and gave the best away performance since god knows when. I will put my neck on the line here and say that we have played some of the best football in recent memory and that includes the final few years of Fergie’s reign. Make no mistake we were pretty dour during his final few seasons, and the last time we played sexy football was in the season of 2007-08 and then for some part of 2009-10.

A lot of our players have come good. Young, Fellaini particularly; You may wince at me but by god people who have been in touch with me will attest to the fact of my unwavering belief in both of them, my refusal to give up on them or abuse them during the darkest of hours of the David Moyes reign. And now I feel vindicated, feel happy that the players that so many United fans had castigated, abused and laughed about have been the shining light of our team in recent weeks. It’s come to the point that Fellaini could be heralded as the mascot of Van Gaal’s methods coming good at United.

Team has found new levels of self-belief and confidence and has started to show some of the arrogance and swagger of old we had in the DF era (During Fergie; PS: BF = Before Ferrgie;AF = After Fergie). The defeat at Chelsea was a chastening experience and we were found to be lacking in some areas but overall there has been progress and there is a case of optimism to be had for the next season. While the pessimist in me warns to tread with caution I like to believe that we have turned a corner and finishing above City would feel so much satisfying and a cause for celebration after the trauma we have had to undergo over the past year and a half.

Till next time…………………
