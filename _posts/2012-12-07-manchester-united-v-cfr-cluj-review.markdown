Ok, first things first. I have been pretty late for my customary review of the game against CFR Cluj and I missed my preview of the game altogether.so let’s get straight into it.

We lost the game at home 1-0 courtesy of a wonder strike. Failure to score has not been a regular thing this season for us but what has stood out is that we end up losing the games that we fail to score in. Away to Everton, Away to Galatasaray, Away to Norwich all ended up in defeats, games where we failed to score. But the manager also remarked that we were pretty wasteful in front of the goal. Tom Cleverley who has been working on timing his runs into the box effectively has started getting into good positions a number of times but fails to find the back of the net after doing the hard work of getting into goal scoring positions in the first place. But it was a very young team and we did pretty ok for that. Phil Jones is still feeling himself into the team and rustiness is expected, after all, lad missed the whole of pre-season.

Coming to the goalkeeping situation David De Gea started the game as expected but I don’t see him start on Sunday. It’s just a hunch and I feel that Fergie may persist with Lindegaard for the time being. I am still scratching my head to come to terms with why De Gea was dropped in the first place? Many of you may be wondering that too.

So the group stages of the Champions league are over. We qualified with two games to spare scrapping through with wins against sub-standard opposition to say the least; Makes me wonder what would have been our fate had we been drawn in Chelsea’s group.

It’s December and we still haven’t clicked defensively and look as uncertain as ever at the back. Coming back with a point from the Etihad will a huge miracle in itself.

I will be back with my preview of the Manchester Derby soon.

Till next time………………………..
