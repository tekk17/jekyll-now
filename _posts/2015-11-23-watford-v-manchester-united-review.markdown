![1375](https://tkalawatia.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/1375.jpg)

It was a trip to Watford this weekend. We did not have our captain and our best striker for the game, travelling without a genuine first team striker to a ground boasting a respectable defence, solid organization and incision on counter made me wary of our prospects. You only had to look at the highlights of Watford’s game against West Ham United and how clinically they dismantled the hammers at home to realize that Watford are not a team to be taken lightly, more so ever at home.

Changes were in order, Memphis made a return to the team and started in the Centre Forward role with Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata on flanks and Ander Herrera behind him. We started off well, Watford in the initial stages seemed content in sitting deep and allowed us to have the ball and thus the lion’s share of possession. While this tactics makes sense, you don’t go to sleep when a genuinely high quality cross come into the box. The centre backs ought to have cleared that ball, allowing Memphis all the time in the world to side foot the ball into the net to round off a neat passing move gave us a lot of confidence. The remaining first half went largely untroubled for us as we passed with authority; crucial changes happened later in the half that had a bearing on our structure.

With Ander Herrera going off injured, Van Gaal opted to bring on Marcos Rojo to change to a 3-man defence with Ashley Young and Daley Blind pushing up as wing backs, the move made sense considering Watford were operating with two strikers, but this did have an impact on our defensive shape. It bought back memories from last season when we would be vulnerable to the onrushing midfield runners, the centre backs would be vary to step out and pick one of them, the central midfielders would not know whether to pick them and thus you would see runners shooting from edge of the box putting our defenders under pressure.

That’s what happened, Watford expectedly upped their intensity in the second half, some quick passing and aggressive play in the final third fashioned clear cut chances, if not for David De Gea they would almost certainly have equalized, the increased width that came with a switch to a 3-4-3 meant we were threatening on the counter, Jesse Lingard found himself in a couple of dangerous situations when he was one on one with goalkeeper and failed to take advantage of those chances. For me it personally felt that it would be a matter of time before Watford would equalize and so they did, in the dying moments of the second half.

If anyone tells me that Marcos Rojo is an upgrade on Jonny Evans then I would almost certainly make the conclusion that he hasn’t comprehensively watched Jonny Evans play. While the reasons why he was let go could make sense, admittedly the spitting incident with Pappiss Cisse and the ensuing 7 game ban did him in, along with a chequered injury record, but one thing Jonny wasn’t and Rojo is, is his over enthusiasm to tackle in the box and concede cheap penalties. It’s almost like a feeling of inevitability to him, making tackles and giving away penalties, you can see it coming, and I had a feeling within me that it was coming and it duly came, a nothing of a scythe on Ighalo, and he was down and the penalty was rightfully given, Watford had equalized, after 600+ minutes of goalless action and David De Gea’s goal had been breached.

What followed afterwards was heartwarming and showed character within the team. One thing I can absolutely compliment Van Gaal on is, his masterful handling of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Basti’s presence in midfield has grown to such an extent that he is now our de-facto midfield general. The resolute passing and alert pouncing on the second ball paid dividends, not to mention the fitness of the players, to show the hunger that they did, to score a goal right from kick off spoke volumes about the confidence within the squad and the belief they have in Van Gal’s methods.

It was a satisfactory three points for us to cap off a 7/10 clinical performance. We just did enough to win on the day, and if you looked at the resources we had at our disposal, it was a job well done.

Man Of the Match: David De Gea

Till next time…………………………..
