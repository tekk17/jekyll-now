A nice end to an hectic period as we wrapped it off with an accomplished 3-0 win away from home against a team that had beaten us by the same margin in January. Remember how I had whined at the thought of Carrick and Scholes starting in midfield and complained about our lack of progress in that area, well it did not turn out to be like that after all! We had a different outlook to our game yesterday, energy in possession and better pressing; Cleverley played and so did Rooney and Kagawa in what was a very new/curious formation for us. It was a very attacking line-up that Fergie had fielded as he knew the magpies were there for the taking. Newcastle were missing the calming influence of Colloccini at the heart of their defense, left back Ryan Taylor and Right back Simpson were not playing either. But apart from that the team had the usual look about them with Demba Ba and an underwhelming Papiss Cisse leading the line supported by Cabaye and Tiote in midfield with Gutierrez and Ben Arfa on the flanks.

Our first two goals were very soft on Newcastle’s part, poor marking on the corners lead to first Evans opening the account and later Evra making it 2-0 and this happened within the first 15 mins. It was quite a welcome break from the usual pattern where we have ended up conceding early on, here we scored first and then doubled our tally even before the game had settled. The third one was a peach of a goal from Cleverley as he curled one in from outside the box. In between that, there were a few worrying moments as no expected Newcastle to go down without a fight on their own patch and they did not either. David De Gea is one of my absolute favorites but he still does not deal with crosses in to the box, he was unconvincing at times yesterday; I reserve the judgment to you on whether that ghost goal that De Gea palmed away from the goal-line should have stood or not. Coming back to De Gea, he still comes up short when it comes to dealing with crosses in the box. He is brilliant when we play in Europe as he does not have to deal with the physicality that the Premier league subjects him to and thus is our unquestionable no.1 but in the premiership Fergie likes to mix it up and I wonder in doing that De Gea does not get subjected to those kind of physical battles and as a result has failed to toughen up in a manner that he should have by now. Of course in having an abled deputy in Lindegaard does not make it easy for the manager when you have to bench a top class goalkeeper like him regularly.

Coming to our shape for the game, we had the look of a 4-3-3, at least defensively with Carrick at the pivot and Cleverley and Rooney playing as the two attacking midfielders ahead of him, Rooney on the other hand was more involved defensively then Cleverley was. Welbeck roughly played on the left with Kagawa on the right and Van Persie through the centre. This was our shape defensively but while attacking we had a very fluent front five where Cleverz, Wazza, Welbeck, Kagawa, and Robin maintained a fluid movement to pass and probe their way through. It was not that beautiful at times and obviously remains a work in progress. Kagawa was very subdued here, and in his defense United just don’t have the system in place right now to take full advantage of him. Making him play on the wings is hardly playing to his strengths and I am still curious about how Fergie plans to utilize him to his full potential to the team’s benefit. Welbeck could have had a hat-trick yesterday, he had that many chances but his finishing and first touch deserted him at times. Van Persie wanted to be more involved in the build up play and thus kept dropping deeper looking for the ball as United played some neat little triangles on the right and left side of the pitch in Newcastle’s half. Rooney’s passing was on the mark as he made some brilliant through passes throughout the game. Cleverley took his goal very well and although kept it simple in his passing he did retain the ball when pressurized in midfield and took some of the knocks that Tiote subjected him to pretty well. Rio was magnificient in defense yesterday as he played a leading role in keeping the toon striker quiet, Evans did a decent job and so did Evra who had one of his good games, although Ben Arfa did run past him quite easily at times, but he almost always had support in Rooney and Carrick.

There were some controversial things that happened too, Van Persie is in hot waters for apparently elbowing Cabaye deep into the second half, the pair had quite a lot of friction yesterday as they had a go at each other throughout the game. Newcastle United Manager Alan Pardew came out to say that some action had to be taken against the apparent elbowing incident that happened, he quite conveniently forgot the deliberate stamp that Tiote did on Cleverley that was gone unnoticed by the ref in the first 10 mins of the game, if he had seen that Tiote would have been sent off. So I say if Van Persie’s incident is reviewed then so should Tiote’s. The disciplinary committee may end up treading into difficult territory here if they do decide to review the Van Persie incident; then United might retaliate themselves by pointing towards the Tiote incident but I am not quite sure whether we will go ahead it with or not. Commenting on the Robin elbowing, it does look deliberate but very soft although it could end up being punishable as there was a similar incident when a Stoke Player [name not known] was punished when he had elbowed Balotelli at the Britannia a few weeks ago. Suspension could mean Robin missing out on the games against Chelsea and Stoke and it could end up hitting us hard. More news on this to follow.

Overall, it was an accomplished performance with good defensive discipline as we played as a unit, although we did lack a definite pattern or flow going forward. Still, trodding along in the right direction as we now head into an international break as players disperse off to play the World Cup qualifiers.

Till next time………………………………………………….......
