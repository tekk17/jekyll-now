These are weird times across Europe at the moment. The big clubs have been struggling in the Champions League for one reason or another making watching the otherwise mundane group stage encounters very exciting. I never thought I would say that.

Bayern Munich were very uncharacteristically sloppy on matchday 2 as they lost to Bate Borisov away from home then and last Tuesday/Wednesday’s games saw Manchester city being humiliated at Ajax, Arsenal gunned down at Emirates, Real Madrid outplayed at the Signal Iduna Park by Dortmund, Chelsea losing in Donetsk and Juve barely scrapping through a draw in Copenhagen against Nordsjaelland.

These are top teams we are talking about here and I haven’t even included two other usual suspects in Manchester united who have been anything but convincing and FC Barcelona who have been leaking goals recently. What has changed all of a sudden? Apart from the Bundesliga clubs who enjoyed their biggest high point of the decade this week with accomplished displays, none of the other clubs from the top echelons of the game have covered themselves in glory here.

While Madrid were reeling from injuries to their key players in full back positions robbing them of the balance to the team, Chelsea were uncharacteristically sloppy against Donetsk. Lampard went off injured in 19 mins and with him went the chance of a Chelsea victory. Now you may think why I would say that when they have such a fine team of attacking talent, but in the champions league it makes no sense to have the best attacking talent at your disposal if you cannot keep the ball and pass it around to discomfort the opponent. Ask Manchester City this, a whole quartet of attacking talent in Silva, Tevez, Aguero and Nasri were rendered ineffective because of a lack of cool head in the midfield, someone who could have passed it around without succumbing to the pressure of pressing.

Madrid on the other hand got simply steamrolled by the brilliant overlapping play of the winger/wingbacks of Dortmund. Essien was badly exposed in the left back position and with Khedira out the side lacked any muscle in the midfield as Modric found it hard to settle, he is still trying to come to terms with the style of play over there and it will take time.

I keep asking myself this question all the time – why is champions league football so difficult to get acclimatised to? Why is it so difficult to win? And the only answer that I can come up with is the superior technical quality of the football on show. I keep asking this question why do these top English clubs get so badly found out in the champions league? And I am still some way from getting to the answer. The only reason I can think of is the organisation of the team and proper passing ability among the players. Building play patiently is of paramount importance here. But teams who are not that high on technical ability use other approaches too. Like a combination of vigorous pressing and fast counter attacks, something that the German clubs used to devastating effect this week or the sit deep and hit on the counter tactic that British clubs especially the English ones tend to adopt. So there are other ways too, ways through which clubs have solved the Champions League conundrum. The margins are so fine at this level that one mistake is all it takes for you get knocked out from the competition.

I am still far from the answer to the question I raised earlier and it will take me quite a lot of time to come up with some kind of a convincing explanation. Let’s see where it goes.

A weekend of fine football awaits!

Till next time……………………………………………………………
