What a day it was! I went through a run of three games over a span of 6 hours witnessing some resilient football full of hard work, grit and determination. It started off with the game at White Hart Lane as Newcastle United aided in a large part by a goalkeeping master class from Tim Krul successfully blanked out Spurs on their home turf on the way to a 3 points that were thoroughly deserved. Their eternal rivals Sunderland got their mojo back with a quite confident performance against Manchester City at the Stadium of Light. This Sunderland team was miles apart from the one that was so poor under Di Canio. The confidence and self belief with which they were passing the ball was a sight to behold at times. The 40k+ crowd of Wearsiders created a quite hostile atmosphere as Sunderland saw out the game. A compact defensive shape, the hunger to fight for lost cause, denying any space in the centre of the pitch and some last ditch defensive clearances in equal measures were required to see of City. A big round of applause to the Swansea and Stoke players too as they played out a quite pulsating 3-3 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Finally, coming to the game of the weekend, Manchester United overcame Arsenal to emerge triumphant 1-0 winners in a tight clash at Old Trafford.
 
It has been quite a long time since Arsenal arrived at Old Trafford as equals, as a team that were perceived as a threat, as a team that were in the title race. The respect that they got from us prior to the game was evident of the fact that Arsenal now is a team to be respected. With some quite extremely credible victories against Napoli, BVB Dortmund and Liverpool, the Gunners have outlined their title credentials and shown steel about them that has been missing for the best part of the last 5 years. 

Having come into this game full of confidence, there was a timidity to Arsenal’s play in the first half. They paid United far too much respect at times and showed a lack of courage in imagination when they had the ball. United team selections were full of logic. As expected Antonio Valencia started on the right, Shinji Kagawa started on the opposite flank with Michael Carrick and Phil Jones in the centre of midfield. Nemanja Vidic partnered Jonny Evans in the centre of defence flanked by Patrice Evra and Chris Smalling on either side. Up front we had Rooney playing in behind Robin van Persie with David De Gea in goal.

The first half of the game was completely dominated by Manchester United. We started well, showed more attacking intent when we had the ball, our off the ball movement in the Arsenal half was good. Defensively Kagawa was stationed on the left, with Phil Jones responsible to do the job of two players in the heart of midfield. Rooney was under instructions to drop deep and track Flamini/ Arteta to ensure we did not get overrun in the centre of midfield. He and RVP took it in turns to thwart Arteta time again as they successfully ensured Arsenal failed to get a rhythm going, being unable to ping together a string of passes. We held a quite compact shape defensively and made sure they could not thread passes through the centre of the pitch. Having pressed high and denied them space and time on the ball, Arsenal resorted to playing it long to Giroud, something that has been quite effective this season as he has performed quite magnificently in that role as a target man. His hold up and link up play, combining with team mates and bringing them into the game has added another dimension to Arsenal’s game; But for the large part of the first half he cut a forlorn frustrated figure as he was expertly marshaled by Nemanja Vidic and Jonny Evans. The ruthlessness with which he was hounded throughout the first half and the cunning that the United centre halves showed to extract cheap fouls out of him ensured Arsenal rarely got going. During a handful of times that he did manage to control the ball and bring his teammates into the game, we made sure we were quicker to the second ball. Such was the defensive performances given by our players that David De Gea virtually got to do nothing for the first half.

Two incidents changed the course of the game, which occurred at the end of the first period. While Szczescny head accident was worrisome and he managed to continue untroubled for the rest of the game, our captain Nemanja Vidic, clattered by De Gea during a corner was left groggy and rendered unable to continue for the second half, these brought about changes for the second period. Tom Cleverley was brought on alongside Michael Carrick, with Phil jones dropping into the centre of defence. With this change Kagawa was instructed to tuck inside alongside Cleverley to give bodies in midfield which freed up ample amount of space on the left wing that Sagna gleefully exploited to bomb forward. His crosses into the final third were delicious and all in danger areas, on any other day against another team, the Gunners’ strikers could have scored at least two. But such was the expertise with which the United centre halves handled the Arsenal strikers, their tight marking and physicality ensured that they could not get to the ball in the danger areas of the 6 yard box and thus were unable to take those chances. Apart from some clearances there was not too much of a threat from the Arsenal forwards as they showed signs of jadedness for the first time this season. The effects on a threadbare squad after the midweek rigors were telling and the international break has come at the right time for them.

Manchester United’s performance in the second half was satisfactory. Choosing to sit deep and break on the counter, we did a good job but were found lacking creatively in the final third of the pitch. Robin Van Persie with an expertly taken goal in the first half, showed some good close control to create space and play in players into dangerous positions in the final third, his outlet ball which was mostly on the right flank brought Valencia into the game. But the strikers were let down repeatedly by quality of Ecuadorian’s deliveries. Absence of Rafael and his failure to spring past Gibbs who did a good job marking him left him completely useless on the right as he was unable to contribute creatively to make the counter attacks count. Kagawa on the opposite wing showed nice touches, close control, kept the ball well and was able to bring his teammates into the game but failed to exert any telling influence, the defensive shift he put in was commendable. 

My man of the match without the shadow of a doubt has to be Wayne Rooney. He played the role of two players yesterday; something that Sir Alex felt was beyond him last season. Diligently dropping deep to track Arteta and making sure he was denied time on the ball, he did the job of an additional midfielder, his tackling and yellow card were stand out moments evident of the fact that he gave a stellar defensive performance. His control of the ball and passing in tight areas were commendable, so was his blossoming partnership with Van Persie. What a change in fortunes a new manager can make. Moyes’ biggest contribution has been the revitalizing of Rooney and for that he should be credited. Coming to the manager, hope he turns a corner from here; it was a game he dare not loose. He made sure his team was prepared and his players did not let him down. A return of 13 points from a possible 15 is a good return but work still needs to be done and we will have to iron out the wrinkles in creative play something that he will have to address in the break.

All in all, it has been a bright start to a week. What a difference a win over your rival makes to your mood on a Monday morning, Something that only football is capable of doing as someone truly said, “A guy can change is girlfriend but not his football club”. Enjoy the break and revel in this victory.

Till next time………………………………………….
