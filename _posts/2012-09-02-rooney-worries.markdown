I have to admit I am very worried about Wayne Rooney's future at our club at the moment. With all the news that's coming out of Old Trafford, agents mouths, newsrooms, there are signs of something being not right. When you look at the overall picture , there are clear signs of discord between the player and the manager if you go by the reports in the media. These reports of rift between the manager and player have gone as far as to a level that even the future of the striker is being questioned at the club beyond next summer.

How did it all come to this? Especially at the end of a season when Rooney had his best goal scoring return for the club. There are many factors attributed to this with the primary being Rooney's fitness and his lethargic attitude towards getting back into shape following the summer break. Things have been not so cordial between our manager and striker either since summer atleast. Rooney's lack of fitness following the summer break and his laziness later to get back into shape has infuriated the manager so much so that he dropped him to bench for the opening game of the season against Fulham.

The signing of Robin Van Persie has not helped matters in Rooney's case either, he can no longer claim to be the top Dog at Old Trafford anymore with Dutchman having a lightning start to life in Manchester and providing a bright future to his career if the link-up play with Kagawa behind him is anything to go by. Further still United looked more cluless and unimaginative when Roo came into the game and United switched from a fluid 4-2-3-1 to last season's favoured formation of 4-4-1-1. Time will tell what formation United settle into over the course of the season as the rigours of the marathon that is club football start to settle in as we approach winter come late october-november.

Regarding United's future without Rooney and if the club indeed are preparing for one without their talismanic striker then there have been reports[unconfirmed, obviously!!] of United having signed an agreement with Borussia Dortmund for signing Robert Leowandowski next summer. Things make for an very interesting reading here if you start believing the news in the media and think of placing together the pieces in the way you love to. Lets see how the season pans out and which Rooney turns up following his injury last week.

Till next time..............................
