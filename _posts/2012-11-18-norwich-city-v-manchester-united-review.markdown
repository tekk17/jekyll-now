The ref called for full time at the end of what had been a very disappointing game for us at Carrow Road. I had my worries about the game, having voiced my concerns in the previous post yesterday where I had commented on how difficult Norwich were as a team to beat and the wonderful work that Chris Hughton was doing there. And that was what was in ample evidence last evening as we got beat by a very good Norwich side who by Fergie’s own admission deserved the victory.

Onto the Fergie comment now, this pattern of him going to press conferences and commending the opposition team for their performance and saying that they were the better team has become quite frequent of late. Last game at Villa it was the same thing when he admitted the Villans deserved something out of the game, and so too at Braga where Mike Phelan openly admitting that United were below par and the scoreline looked flattering at best. This is turning into a regular pattern here, where we have been abysmal in many of our games, very shabby defensively conceding poor goals and then relying on our famed attacking quartet to rescue us. It won’t happen all the time just like yesterday. We are still operating well below our best yet and apart from the 20 minute period at Chelsea we have not looked convincing at all this season.

How many times have I said that a midfield pairing of Carrick and Giggs just won’t work. It hasn’t worked for us at all this season and it did not yesterday too. We were too languid in our approach play. RVP left his shooting boots in Manchester and just failed to take any of the chances that came his way. On any other day he would have absolutely buried them. Valencia was brilliantly doubled up on the right and rarely put in any crosses of note into the box. Hernandez was on the periphery of the game for quite a long time and thus substituted on the hour mark. I could count the number of chances of note that we created on the back of the fingers of one hand, that was how impotent we were yesterday on the attacking front. We missed Rooney badly yesterday.

Ok you might say that it is so easy to pin the defeat on the absence of one player. But he could have made a real difference. He is a different kind of player who likes to operate between the lines and could have caused damage by operating between the two banks of four that were impenetrable to Norwich’s credit. United lacked that spark player on the pitch yesterday, someone who could have conjured something out of nothing against a side that were resolute defensively. Even a Kagawa could have made a difference yesterday, again a player of the kind that likes to operate between the lines. With Hernandez already on the pitch we did not have a super-sub on the bench waiting to score goal a either; Welbeck came on but he has been short on confidence of late due to his lack of game time and thus his lack of impact.

United were poor yesterday, we were just completely outplayed for the entire game by Norwich. And I will give the credit where it is due. I used to watch a lot of Football League Show highlights from last season and the brilliant work that Chris Hughton did at Birmingham City was commendable. Operating on a shoestring budget he made Birmingham play good football by making them very tight at the back and thus being a side very difficult to bat. How else could you explain the miracle he performed at the club by taking them to the play-offs on the budget that he was operating on with the players that he had. So when Norwich announced that they would be appointing Hughton as their next manager, I was not surprised in the slightest as I had complete belief in the ability of this man that he had the potential to take this club forward and better Paul Lambert’s achievements.

And that is what he has done. I mentioned yesterday on his philosophy that was being imprinted on the team and the past results give evidence to the fact. You don’t outplay Arsenal without proper defensive organisation in the side. That win was a sign that things were improving for them and that yesterday’s game would be no walkover. Fergie might have sensed it too but his rotational policy and apparent loyalty to Giggs might have cost us a win here. I am not blaming Giggsy for the loss, it was a collective performance that contributed to the result but why Fergie went with this midfield pairing when we have seen clearly over the season that it does not work for us anymore is open to question.

Its three losses already and we are only in the month of November. We usually lose 4 games a season but this season could see us loose more. There is a sense of instability to the side and even with 11 games into the season I have to say we are yet to find the perfect balance of defence and attack in the team. We wither attack too much and get caught out on the break [v Spurs] or end up sitting too deep protecting a lead [v Chelsea]. The balance has not been struck. It has been a common them where we have been very susceptible defensively, shipping goals that a Manchester United side never should. And fans pining for the return of Nemanja Vidic to the side by Christmas should heed caution; I wonder how much of an instant impact he could have on the side after being out for the best part of a year.

The warning bells are ringing and be prepared to see us lose some more games before the end of the season. Whether the title comes back with us will hinge on the number of wins and the number of games that we convert to wins from draws.

Till next time……………………………………………………..
