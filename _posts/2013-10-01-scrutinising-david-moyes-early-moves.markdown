![Moyes]({{ site.url }}/images/article-2437695-1859CA8E00000578-192_634x396.jpeg)

Three months into the tenure, the start has been as expected, but David Moyes has to answer some rather discomforting questions that perplexed fans have been haplessly asking.

After being spoilt for the best part of living memory time has come when reality has started to bite. No one expected it to be a seamless transition barely being noticeable, It was always going to be a change of seismic proportions that would always be very difficult to get acclimatized with and that is what is happening. Suffering defeats will be the norm in the coming months and I would like to revise my expectations for the season from a trophy winning one to a best of a top-4 finish being completely satisfactory.

These defeats over the past few weeks have really hurt. The West Brom loss at Old Trafford felt more painful than the derby defeat to be honest. These subtle changes in the dynamics of team play, tweaks in the playing system have had a profound effect on our style so much so that there is no clear identity, emphasis on a particular style of play either defensively or offensively. One moment said it all, it was after the 80th minute, trying to force the issue trailing 2-1, there was Michael Carrick trying to close down a centre half in their own half in a rather futile attempt.

Here is your midfield general, who dictates the flow and tempo of your play and he is running like a headless chicken all over the park trying to close down a centre half! I would like to see what the opta stats are on the amount of distance that Carrick has covered since the season began, because I haven’t seen him run so much in the past three seasons. A player who has been excellent at reading the game, intercepting passes and being very astute positionally, has been trying to close people down with his running, no wonder the back four has been left exposed time and time again. This for me is the worst change that Moyes has done to a perfectly functioning system. Redefining Carrick’s role into a sitter and more than half of our problems will be instantly solved, mark my words.

Other thing has been the players chosen to play and the substitutions that have gone horribly wrong for us. Why did Buttner start in the first place? Why was Kagawa substituted, I for one believe that his technical abilities could have helped us better in the second half when he would have had time on the ball due to tiring players. Evra should have been brought on at the stroke of second half, and why did Fabio not start on the left? That boy is crying for a chance, Moyes could not have done worse than play him; at least he could have contributed in the attacking part of the field. Bringing on Januzaj was a huge mistake. It was asking too much from him, he appeared a tad sluggish to begin with and did not show the spark that he did against Crystal Palace a fortnight ago. These bungling selections and substitutions have cost the team dear.

And the biggest concern for me is his handling of Robin van Persie. There is no second though to the fact that he is being overworked in training which is just not necessary. While Moyes’s training methods are hands-on, the rigorous training regime is not going to suit a player of Robin van Persie’s frame, someone who needs to be handled with soft hands, and we all know what he is capable of when fit.

Tough times call for patience when as I have written about here already we will need bucket loads of. Criticizing our players and berating them is not going to help. This is our team, our manager and our players and it is our duty to support them through thick and thin.

Enjoy the game tomorrow night.

Till next time……………………
