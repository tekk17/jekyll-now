Supporting Manchester united comes with its perks. The low points are few and far between so much so that rival fans aim barbs at us ranting that we are a bunch of glory hunters, those that only support the club since they win, much to my annoyance but it may be true to a certain extent.

Coming to the lows that we occasionally have to painfully go through, when these lows strike, they are very painful. It’s been 15 years since I have been a red devil, and there have been low points in my life as a Manchester United fan. Think about the fracas that unfolded at the final whistle at Old Trafford in August 2003 at the end of an ill-tempered 0-0 draw against Arsenal, the 3-0 Chelsea beating that followed two years later, again at home; the 3-0 demolition at Milan in 2007, those double defeats in 07-08 against City in the 50th Anniversary year of the Munich disaster, the 4-1 hammering at the hands of Liverpool on our own patch in 2009, the 6-1 defeat against City from October last year or the very bad abysmal performance again against City at the Etihad stadium last April when we went down 1-0.

You know, for me the lowest point was the 4-1 defeat against Liverpool, because here we were flying in all competitions, a team that could be said was one of the strongest that Fergie has ever assembled in his reign and we were brought down with a thud by the sheer brilliance of Fernando Torres. That man single handedly on that Sunday afternoon made sure that Nemanja Vidic missed out on the player of the year award.

I can start a huge debate here, where you all would be very quick to jump in and say that the real nadir was the 6-1 defeat at home last year at the hands of City, every single goal that day was a painful blow, and it took me the best part of last season to come to terms with that defeat but it happened again last April, when instead of taking the battle to them we just gave up, played for a draw, went with a negative submissive attitude with our tails curled up firmly between our legs and came back with eggs splattered all across our face. For me that period of the season when we lost to Wigan first then drew at home to Everton and then lost the title at the City was one of ‘THE’ biggest low points of my life as a Red Devil and I have to admit I have been feeling the after effects of that dreadful fortnight from April till today. Those run of games still scare the hell out of me.

And, we resume the rivalry today again; the balance in Manchester on tenterhooks at the moment, City could have embarked on a total dominance in the Manchester and the whole of England if Mancini could have had his wish in the summer. Fergie the wily old fox that he is remained true to his trait and brought in Robin Van Persie to restore the wow factor back to the side ever since our Portuguese prodigal son left for the sunny days of Madrid.

The “WELCOME TO MANCHESTER” poster still glistens into my memory; it was a sign that City were serious and ready to take the battle to us for the supremacy in Manchester. Its three years now and Fergie’s comments that they won’t win the title, not in my lifetime he had said just remind us how far City have come since then.

As far as I am concerned, our fierce eternal rivalry with Liverpool still remains very close to my heart. City will remain as inferiors to me, someone to look down at forever.

Enjoy the game today.

Till next time………………………..
