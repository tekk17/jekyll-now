As the covering came off and we were treated to the statue that will grace the (North) Sir Alex Ferguson stand, what a bloody proud moment it was for the Manchester United family; seeing our legendary manager immortalised by the beautiful bronze statue as Catherine Ferguson took off the cover to unveil the statue to the world, his past 26 year reign flashed across our eyes bringing into perspective the excellent work he has done for the club that led to this proud moment. Fergie by his own admission was ecstatic as he revealed his happiness at the sight of being presented with an honour that not so many get to see in their lifetime.

For me there are no words there that can sum up the gratitude and the respect that I have for our manager. He is the sole reason why Manchester United have became so successful and thus the sole reason why I as a kid fell in love with this greatest of clubs and became a lifelong Red Devil fan something that I will be so so proud of for the rest of my life.
