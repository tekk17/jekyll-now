Football is back! Tonight we embark upon a new season as the Championship first gets underway and tomorrow Manchester United kick off the new Premier League campaign against Spurs at Old Trafford at Lunchtime. The off season seems to have passed away in a blur. We had the Copa America and also the pre-season freindlies but I made a concerted effort to stay away from the game for 2 months so that I came back refreshed and yearning for it once we were into August; Its been worth it. I kick started my season with the Community Shield last Sunday. A gripping game which in truth was nothing more than a pre-season charity match but it had decent quality. I am not one of those who is going to pay a lot of attention to the form or displays of teams in the pre-season friendlies or pass any judgement on players based on how many tree they have pulled up. These games are mainly there for the players to get used to each other again, ease themselves back into action and build match fitness.

Manchester United have had a good summer, decent signings with money being spent on areas that needed strengthening. Pre-season has been good to an extent. From the looks of it Van Gaal is preferring a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Depay behind Rooney, quite how then he intends to fit the plethora of central midfielders at his disposal is now open to question. I for one believed that we would have continued with the 4-1-4-1/4-3-3 formation from the Autumn of last season that brought us such good rewards, only time will tell which formation becomes our starting shape. The David De Gea saga has been looming large on the club for a while now, add to the fact that Victor Valdes has been made available for transfer compounds our goalkeeper situation to a worrying degree. I just don’t believe Sergio Romero to be the no.1 goalkeeper for a club of Manchester United’s class. The way Valdes has been treated has not left a good impression on the supporters as almost everyone instantly warmed up to him owing to his CV and also the passion and dedication that he brings to his game. For him to be treated the way he was by Van Gaal gave the signal that the manager was making a big statement of authority to his players clearly emphasizing that there is only one way you work at this club and that is the Van Gaal way.

I am excited to see how we are going to fare this season, we have been crying out for good midfielders for years and we finally have them, we finally have a proper Midfield something that will give us greater fluency, tempo and cotnrol over games. We will need to have to find a level of consistency over the course of a campaign if we truly have to mount a serious title challenge. Winning games on a stretch, being solid defensively will be at the top of the list among the concerns supporters will have this time, because make no mistake Van Gaal has to make sure his team mounts a creadible title challenge this time around and some silverware is won. We make a return to the champions league subject to qualification through the playoffs which could be tricky but something that we should manage to achieve. With the squad that the mnager has at his disposal, juggling of resources will be key and something that will obviously be done to ensure we have all the players fit and firing and happy making a contribution to the team’s success. Hope we have a good season that leaves us satisfied.
