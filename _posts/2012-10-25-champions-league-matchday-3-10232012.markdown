Manchester United wrapped up the game against Braga with a 3-2 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday after going behind 2-0 in the first half. It was a predictable pattern to the one that has been going on for the past few weeks where we conveniently fall behind through some inept defending and then use our attacking quartet to do the job for us. A shabby defence, a non-existential midfield and the best strike force in Europe is what we are in a nutshell at the moment. I am still waiting for that part of the season to begin when we start raking in a few 1-0 victories with some solid defensive performances. Next few weeks are very important for us as we first enter into a double header with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premiership on Sunday and then the League Cup in midweek. While eliminating them out of the cup will be great news for me but not at the cost of a loss on Sunday. A defeat at the weekend is unthinkable. A 7 point gap will be telling should we lose there while a draw will be an acceptable outcome; not hoping for a win obviously going by the poor record we have over there for the last decade; more on the game in the coming days hopefully.

In other news, Barcelona beat Celtic at the Nou Camp in a tense encounter with Jordi Alba scoring the winner in the 94th minute to beat the Scottish giants in a 2-1 victory. Barca have been shipping goals lately, their defence has been very vulnerable of late and their famed pressing almost non-existent. There has been a change in philosophy to the way the team plays under Vilanova. They attack at a greater pace with a high tempo then they used to under Guardiola and their famed pressing has also been missing. They have been winning and so the various tactical decisions and style of play the new manager has been trying to inculcate there has not come under question yet but should they fail to shore up that leaky defence, the days of trouble won’t be far away. Madrid for me still are the team to beat both in Spain and Europe. With Mourinho at the helm I am confident that his pragmatic safety first approach will make sure that his side tightens up at the back which is the key to a successful campaign.

In other games, Chelsea lost to Shakhtar Donetsk at the Donbass arena where the goals came through serious individual mistakes courtesy of the blues players; taking no credit away from the Shakhtar, who were devastating on the counter as they ripped Chelsea to shreds through sheer pace and high tempo pressing. They missed Lampard’s cool head at the heart of the midfield in this game; his injury was detrimental to their chances of coming away with the spoils.

Juventus meanwhile had to rely on a late Mirko Vucinic goal to win a point against Nordsjaelland in Copenhagen. How a team that has one of the best midfield and defence in Europe, is somehow short of top class strikers is a mystery to me. Watch out for this space as this group of Juve, Chelsea, Shakhtar and Nordsjaelland will be throwing quite a few surprises in the coming weeks apart from the group of death about which I will be going into detail later on.

Till next time……………………………………………..
