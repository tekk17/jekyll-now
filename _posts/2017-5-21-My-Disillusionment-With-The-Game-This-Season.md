title: My Disillusionment With The Game This Season
---
The football season is coming to a close, one by one all of them are about to finish their final rounds, titles in two of the major leagues, Germany and England have already been decided with Italy and Spain to follow tonight. There’s a top four race to be won in England, an FA Cup final, a Europa League Final and finally the climax on June 3 with the Champions League Final in Cardiff.

How has the season panned out for you? 

For me its personally been one those times when I have felt totally disillusioned with the game at various points over the season. There are myriad reasons for that which I will explain here, but first let me lay down the groundwork for these.

I am an unabashed football romantic. I dream and fantasize about Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona era, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Man United from 2008, 1999, Jurgen Klopp’s BVB Dortmund from 2010. I have seen things this season that have killed the romantic in me, but mind you there have been things that have made my heart warm too, Monaco’s title triumph, the Champions league quarter final between them and Dortmund, Tottenham, how they have evolved into everyone’s favourite second team this season, wonder how they would have coped with the pressure of being within 3 points of Chelsea come April, you can only wonder.

Coming to the disappointing things, it all starts with my club Manchester United. I am not a glory hunter, I have stayed true to my team, players and the various managers that have been with us for the past few years. I have trusted them to get things right over time, believing in their decisions, trusting them with what they were doing even when they weren’t making much sense. But this season has been a tipping point for me personally.

Jose Mourinho, a man who had been dreaming about this job for years, who paced his career intentionally in a way that would get him this job has been downright disappointing in his first season. It doesn’t matter to me personally even if we win the Europa League final this season. You look at our manager and ask where has his charm, happiness gone? He always seems to be in a war with either himself, his players or the entire world depending on what month of the year it is. I had expected a happy Jose, someone who would bring some much needed happiness to the place after years of gloom, but that hasn’t been the case. His aura, smartness has gone and all we have is a grumpy old man who is always sad and irritated with people. You rarely see him all shaved up in a good suit standing by the touchline watching his players run through a brick wall for him. His unimaginative tactics at time have left me befuddled. Making his most creative players play as auxiliary fullbacks in the big games have shown that he doesn’t quite trust the defensive solidity of his players who are playing in the back line. Playing 9 behind the ball with Rashford to feed of long deliveries has been a common sight in the past month, is that all that Manchester United have been reduced to? 

I can understand to an extent that he doesn’t trust some of the players fully with quite a few players that will be shown the door this season, but to show such un-imagination at various points has been exasperating to the point that I have started feeling indifferent towards my team, something that I never actually dreamed would happen to me. 

I really hope we get to see the charming wily Jose again. A man who was a master at playing mind games with his fellow managers, who knew how to play big games, mind you I have no problem sitting deep and playing for the counter in big games, it’s the approach and the lack of imagination that his team has shown in the past weeks that has been disappointing.

For the obscene amount of money that the club spent over the summer, the return that we have received is ordinary. The obscene amount of money that we paid to Mino Raiola for the Pogba signing was preposterous. That much amount to an agent is setting dangerous precedent, but I do believe this practice has been in vogue for a long time and only the leaked details of the Pogba deal have bought this into public attention. This has happened earlier before cue Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and will continue to happen this summer when Griezmann, James and co move clubs. With the amount of money flying around the Premier clubs from the television rights deal, the commercialization, the social media presence, it’s like the games has been robbed of its romance. 

It’s made me wonder whether following a game in the lower leagues would make some sense? Whether playing Football manager will? Whether following a club in Bundesliga would? Would those clubs from Germany or Spain or Italy do anything differently to the clubs in England had when they have been awash with this much money? I certainly don’t think so. It’s the sign of changing times, maybe I have refused to move with times, maybe this is 21st century football and it’s just that I have struggled to come to terms with it. 

Football is changing, has changed and it won’t wait for me, it has already moved ahead and I am gathering myself up, desperately trying hard to keep pace with it, hoping against hope that It doesn’t kill the romantic in me.

Till next time………….
