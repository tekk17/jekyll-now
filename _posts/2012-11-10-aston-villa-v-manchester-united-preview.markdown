It’s the Diwali weekend here in India, and the quality of football that is on offer for the coming two days will make sure that this could be one of the biggest weekends in a long time. We play tonight as United make the trip to midlands to face Aston Villa at Villa Park. Then tomorrow night we have a double header with Spurs making the trip to the Etihad Stadium to face City and we round off the day with Chelsea at Anfield; Isn’t that mouthwatering to say the least.

Coming to our game, which is the main focus of my attention right now; we make the trip to Villa Park on the back of 3 wins out of 4 in all competitions. Our most recent outing being in the Champions league where we emerged victorious 3-1 against Sporting Braga, the score line looked very flattering if you had watched the tepid performance we gave there, we were dominated for large parts and only came alive in the final 30 minutes after Robin Van Persie was brought on to the pitch.

Having now wrapped up the Champions League qualification with two games to spare, at least I am saved of the embarrassment that I had to go through from last year when we spectacularly failed to make the cut and then had to play in the Europa League, which was even more painful than coming last in the group.

Enough of nostalgia for now, coming onto the team news, Jonny Evans is doubtful for the game having picked up a groin injury against Braga, and will have to pass a fitness test to be eligible to play tonight. He has been one hell of a consistent defender for us over the past months and his start to this season completely typifies the fine form he has been over the last year. He is hard to notice and is much underestimated as a result of it. But I am happy to see that he is getting the recognition that he so truly deserves. Fergie has done a remarkable job in keeping faith and persisting with him especially during that season of turmoil between 2010-2011 when he used to be so easily out muscled by the physical centre forwards. His passing has also come a long way since. Hope another concern, the perennial scapegoat along with Evans, Anderson also comes through and becomes a key player for us just like Jonny boy has. Just imagine how proud Fergie would glow if Ando also comes through this abyss in which his career has fallen into in the past few years.

Nani is expected to miss with a stiff hamstring and is sidelined for the next 10 days. Chris Smalling who made a successful comeback from injury in midweek could play alongside Rio if Evans fails to make the cut. Tom Cleverley and Carrick could start again after being rested in midweek. I would also like to see Darren Fletcher feature in the Premiership for us; Fergie has been very cautious in his handling of him and has rarely given him time in the Premier League whereas he has featured in almost all of our games in the Champions League and also in the League Cup; The midfield selection for tonight’s game will be very interesting especially since now we have started to reach the point when the grind that the Premiership is kicks in and Fergie uses his rotation policy to keep players fresh.

No issues with injuries in the forward line for us at the moment and we are near full strength here except for Shinji who will be out for the best part of this month. No.4 Phil Jones continues his rehabilitation and is expected to be back soon. God! I am so missing seeing him play. He was brilliant in the first half of last season for us before fading in the latter part.

That’s that for now. Enjoy your weekend with the quality football on offer. I will be back with the review tomorrow.

Till next time…………………………………..
