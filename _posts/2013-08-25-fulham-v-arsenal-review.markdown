I tuned in last evening to watch an Arsenal game with the expectation that it was going to be a close-run affair, with an opening day defeat at the hands of a an Aston Villa side that ripped them to shreds by rapid counter-attacks, I was expecting a good game of football from both sides in a tight affair.

I fancied Fulham to run the Gunners close and probably sneak a point having conveniently overlooked the fact how good Arsenal were against Fenerbahce in mid-week; what followed was a lesson in possession based passing football and when properly applied makes Arsenal into a fearsome attacking unit. Santi Cazorla, Rosicky, and Ramsey in particular displayed the touch, vision and awareness that Wenger has always craved from his players. Right from the get go the Gunners displayed a touch, assurance and a calm that was severely lacking in their game from last week.

It all started from the back, with Szczescny passing the ball to his centre halves who bought it out of defence even under periods of sustained Fulham pressure. Fulham did have a semblance of a plan, of pressing Arsenal high up the pitch, trying to stop the build-up play; trouble for the cottagers began when the midfield and the wingers failed to provide that second blanked of pressure once the Arsenal players had evaded the pressing from the attackers. Defensive organisation of Fulham was pretty poor, their wide players, Taraabt in particular failed to track back or give any protection to Riisse what so at all. He was left isolated in a 2 on 1 situation almost all afternoon, meaning a central midfielder had to cover for him, leaving space in midfield that the Gunners so gleefully exploited. Overloads on the right led to spaces being created on the left and Lukas Podolski duly capitalised in a week when there have been rumors of him returning to Germany with Schalke.

Not taking any credit away from the Gunners, who were very impressive in almost all areas of the pitch. Bacary Sagna looked a very good make-shift centre-back and can be expected to occupy that position more often this season if Wenger fails to bring in another defender to cover for his problematic threadbare defensive options. Ramsey played with a poise and maturity beyond his years yesterday as he displayed a tactical side to his game in the central midfield position, at the pivot of a triumvirate. His maturity and defensive duties were particularly outstanding given he was booked within a quarter of a game. Cazorla looked at his best, as he weaved and escaped one Fulham flailing tackle after another, fearlessly asking for the ball in tight positions and giving it back. Podolski enjoyed one of his better days in an Arsenal shirt and I would like to see him give it another shot in the premiership this season, having given a return of 15 goals in an rather underwhelming season last time underlines the potential over how effective he could get this time around with a bit more application. His counterpart on the right has looked dangerous all along, Walcott, who has been on the receiving end of many a rants from my side has started showing his skills a striker/wide forward; as he has repeatedly shown signs of accomplishment in this position over the past year. Coming to their primary striker, Giroud who is enjoying a very bright purple patch at the moment, led the line with great valor, held the ball up, combined with his teammates and scored a very well taken goal to cap off a very strong performance.

For what its worth, my man of the match has to be Aaron Ramsey who has been nothing short of brilliant over the past few months, as he shows signs of fulfilling the vast potential that he has always had, finally vindicating the unwavering trust that Wenger has shown in him. It has the to be the stubbornness in Wenger, the refusal to give up and the belief in his potential that his faith in Ramsey has remained unwavered.

Till next time...........................................................
