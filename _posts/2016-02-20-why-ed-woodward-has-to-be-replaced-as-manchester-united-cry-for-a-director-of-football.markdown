![WOODWARD]({{ site.url }}/images/111_18914938.jpeg)

It’s not a good time to be a Manchester United fan right now. Sure, the haters are reveling in our current plight as we keep falling from one major crisis into another; for me this is a crisis that has been of our own making and the rot starts right from the top.

Its December, rewinding back to that epochal afternoon at cold, wet and windy Stoke, that day Manchester United under Louis Van Gaal hit their lowest, the football was uninspired, the players demoralized, a culmination of events that started from November and reached its zenith on that fateful day.

In the aftermath of the defeat, an unconfirmed media report from credible sources mentioned Louis Van Gaal offering to resign from his position and was rebuffed by the club CEO Ed Woodward, who wanted him to continue, he asked him to think over it for the weekend and see if he still felt the same on Tuesday. And we all know how that played out.

Ed Woodward, has been under as much pressure as Louis Van Gaal, for me this man has made more blunders that the two managers (Moyes and Van Gaal) combined. The Fellaini signing, a 100mn pound failed pursuit of Gareth Bale, the flirting with Sergio Ramos, the Neymay bids, Thomas Muller bids, appointment of Louis Van Gaal, the list goes on. For him the sacking of Van Gaal would signal that he got his big managerial appointment wrong. Make no mistake about it, this was a Woodward appointment, and if Sir Alex was blamed for the Moyes fiasco, then Ed has to carry the responsibility for this decision.

And if you now add this blunder to the list of all the previous ones he has already made, then there could be a case made for his sacking as the club CEO, because for me this man is equally culpable as Van Gaal is for the mess we find ourselves in as far as the football matters of our club is concerned. Let him be on the business side and take the club to the top in Deloitte money league, but he has to be replaced as the club CEO, Period

The Midtjylland defeat was another embarrassment for the club and fans in particular; there is almost a feeling of resignation to our current plight as we are lurching from one crisis to another with a lame duck manager who clearly has lost the confidence of his players.

But his sacking comes with a caveat, who could replace him? Well there is the obvious choice in Jose Mourinho, a top grade trophy winning machine who is available, hungry and ready to prove himself again after his tumultuous reign at Chelsea, but the opinions seems divided, not all at the club want him, a divisive figure who seems to fall out with everyone in his 3rd year, add to that his poor record at bringing through young players and the jury is supposedly out.

And if not him then who? Giggs? If Woodward wanted Giggs, he would have been the manager by now or hold on, if Van Gaal got sacked who would come across as the one who got it wrong? Ed Woodward, it’s a circle of failure that starts and ends with the club CEO, and that my reader is the main reason why our club is crying out for a continental style director of Football who can oversee the football matters while we let Ed look after business matters, something that he is extremely good at.

Now we know why we find ourselves in this mess.

Till next time………….
