First a home game against Spurs followed by a trip to Romania to face Cluj and then a trip up north to face Newcastle on tyneside within a week will provide quite a test for us, after which the players go off on international duties for the second round of their World Cup qualifiers; Coming through unscathed will be quite an achievement for us.

Manager in his usual press conference today echoed similar sentiments when he stressed upon  keeping the only two centre halves fit for coming games and mind you that would be quite a task. He also mentioned that Scott Wootton who was so impressive for us against Newcastle will play a part in the game against Spurs and is expected to feature on the bench at least. Daily Mail also were impressed by our other young centre half Michael Keane who along with Wootton was so impressive in the last game. On other news, Fergie made light weight of the injury scare suffered by Valencia at Anfield last week and mentioned that he expected him to feature almost certainly against Cluj and did not rule him out of tomorrow's game either. Comeback hero Darren Fletcher is also expected to feature tomorrow from the bench.

Sir Alex made quite an interesting point today on the position that he had deployed Fletcher in and praised his performance. Fletch was deployed in the holding midfield role shielding the defense and given the instruction to play the role of an midfield anchor rather than the Box-to-Box role that he has played with such accomplishment over the years. It will be interesting to see which role he continues to play regularly once he is blended completely into the first team squad. Him going to train with the Scotland National team and also being expected to play a part will be a confidence boost for the player. Rooney will also be expected to feature tomorrow although I am not sure whether he will start the game or not.

Spurs will be a very difficult opposition for us and will not make for an easy picking. Moussa Dembele returns to the scene of the excellent performance he gave in a Fulham shirt last August when he ran the show with some powerful runs through the heart of  midfield albeit in a loosing cause. Defoe for me could be a threat as he is in the middle of an hot streak right now and keeping him quiet will be important. Spurs midfield is also taking shape with a fluid triumvirate of Dembele, Sandro and Siggurdsson showing signs of gelling together in a new look 4-2-3-1 formation that Spurs are still trying to come to terms with. They are still though much more dangerous and comfortable playing in last season's 4-4-2 or the 4-4-1-1 formation. What Tottenham manage to get out from the game will depend on how AVB lines up his team and the approach they adopt. The manager has certainly been riding on a high right now with back to back victories against Reading and QPR, not to forget the win against Carlisle in midweek in the League Cup. All in all it will be a very good game of Football as we face our first test at home albeit against a team that we have done very well against with Spurs never winning here since 1989; I am hoping for the full 3 points here with an accomplished performance to add to it. Have a nice weekend.

Till next time........................................................................................
