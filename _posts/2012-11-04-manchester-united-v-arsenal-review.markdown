It was a typical Saturday for me. You get up in the morning with excitement, a feeling that you have when you know that a evening of fine football awaits you, there was anxiety in the air too, after all Arsenal were coming to town. It is a tough game for us no doubt about it. But for one reason I never had this feeling in my head that we would lose it; that thought just never occurred to me. No disrespect to Arsenal here, they are a very good side and in A few months, after they have played much more we could start seeing the best of them but for now, we are ahead of them by a mile, it was such a one-sided game yesterday that I did not even have to worry one bit. Arsenal rarely ventured forward or created any chances of mention, they were that poor going forward yesterday, it was disappointing to watch from a fan’s perspective, when you see a team known for its attacking prowess come and play like that, play like the way they did yesterday, and it was not heart-warming to say the least.

I have grown up on the memories of those iconic encounters that used to symbolise these two sides and the huge rivalry that they had over the best part of ‘90s and the early 20th century, the match that made Giggsy immortal; the Sylvain Wiltord goal that rounded off the title for Gunners in 2002, the 0-0 draw in the invincible season at Old Trafford, the pizzagate controversy of 2004, the tunnel gate controversy involving the legends Vieira and Keane from 2005, the late Adebayor goal that won Arsenal the game at Old Trafford in 2006, those are the games that you remember, the games that symbolise the rivalry that these clubs have had over the years, but Arsenal have steadily gone backwards for some reason or the other [so much has been written about it already] so much so that there hardly has been any rivalry between us. No more animosity between the players, no bad blood, the managers being amicable so much so that Fergie now refers to Wenger as Arsene, that really shows the extent to which Arsenal have come down such that Fergie does not consider them a threat anymore.

Enough of going down the memory lane, onto the game now; Fergie got it right when he said in the earlier press meetings that it was going to be a “hard-ish” game, yeah that’s what he said you know, but to be frank, it was not even a “hard-ish” game, it was an easy game. Arsenal started nervously, they sat deep in the earlier minutes determined not to concede, but Vermaelen, their captain who hardly inspires any confidence defensively, was culpable here as he gifted that one player with a goal, that the gooners would have never have wanted to, even if he was the last man on the earth! And thus the pattern followed, to their credit Arsenal pressed well after that but were very jittery uncharacteristically, as whenever United had the ball in the final third, they threatened, Rooney was good with his playmaking and did well to setup Van Persie from a very tight angle, Valencia kept nutmegging Andre Santos so easily that you wondered whether he was there at all, yeah this guy Santos was so poor, especially in the first half, that it made you cringe, Valencia made him look like a school kid there. United duly won a penalty which Rooney failed to convert, I felt it from the moment he was going to take it that he would miss. He had misplaced a few passes before that, and it did not seem right and he duly missed to prove me correct.

Onto second half, Arsenal never came off the blocks early here too, United set the early pace and could have gone 2-0 or even 3-0 up within 3 minutes had it not been for some wasteful attacking, then the Gunners had their best period of the game, between 48-58 mins when they showed a glimpse of their attacking prowess, but here too, when Santos made some runs on the left to put some decent balls into the box, there was no one waiting for him, yeah, none! Zero, those were the number of players in the box to convert chances, wonder whether the gunners had any desire to win here, I have a feeling they came here to make sure that it was not going to be a repeat of the 8-2 from last year, but it could well have been 5-1 or 6-1 to us had we taken our chances more effectively. They were that bad. After that 10 minute period Arsenal went back to being how they had been for the greater part of the game, utterly inept attacking wise. Wilshere was getting frustrated, after getting booked earlier in the first half, he repeatedly committed fouls and it all came to an end in 63rd minute when he got sent off and with that went the chances of a win if there were any. Gooners may point towards Cleverley and that he should have been off too, but like Wilshere he had received a warning after a foul that he committed after he first received a yellow, Sir Alex sensed the red mist descending and aptly took him off; and replaced him with the brilliant Anderson.

The game went along the same pattern till the end, United kept the ball, threatened to score and should have but it was just that kind of a day when we were squandering chances, finally Cazorla scored from the last kick of the game. It was for me a very nice present from the diminutive magician to his supporters who sang their hearts out once again and made themselves heard against the majority. Their love for the club should be commended for the heart and spirit they showed as they sang for their team through the afternoon, shame that their team could not repay it with a performance, a scoreline of 5-1 , 6-1 would not have been surprising. Yes, Arsenal were that poor yesterday.

Till next time……………………………………………………………….
