The transfer window is fast drawing to a close, and as far as we are concerned it would well already be shut as far as new arrivals are concerned. But there could be few who could depart the club before tomorrow midnight, with Berbatov almost a certainty , Nani still considering his options and Anderson could also be sold if reports in the vaious media outlets are to be believed.

As far as the arrivals are concerned, we are done and dusted with them. I hopelessly waited the entire summer for Fergie to sign one good box to box midfielder to add some much needed bite in the midfield, but there were no moves for any of them. We were interested in Luka Modric at some point, but Tottenham's hardline stance of not selling domestically and the steep asking price did us in. Failed moves for Eden Hazard first and Lucas Moura later further highlighted the stance of our club on the refusal to pay astronomical fees to agents and clubs alike. These things happening in the midst of all the chaos that unfolded as the club was floated at the Stock Excahnge in Cayman Islands further worsened the wounds of die-hard supporters and made me wonder what could have been had it not been for the ill-fated Glazer takeover of 2005.

Signing Van Persie was definitely a statement of intent and I have a feeling it could pave the way for Rooney being sold next summer. NIck Powell has been obviously absent uptill now. I am expecting to see Ryan Tunnicliffe being given a chance. My knowledge about him on his fitness and form are unknown at the time of writing and thus the unknown reason over why I have not seen him yet anywhere near the first team fold. But i do expect him to feature in the first team plans or atleast on the fringes as we seek to add some much needed bite to our physically weak midfield.

A trip to St.Mary's awaits this Sunday as we look to have a clean sheet and a first away win to our credit.

Till Next Time........................
