The draw has been made. It’s been almost a week since I have been feeling jittery about this draw that took place today. I had this huge feeling inside me, much more of a surety that Manchester United would be drawn against Real Madrid in the Champions League. I even spoke to my roommate about this and expressed my thoughts that either it would be now in the pre-quarters or in the quarter finals when Manchester United would play Real Madrid and the Gods have given me my wish as we make the trip to Santiago Bernabeu in February to face a Cristiano Ronaldo led Real Madrid.

There were reasons; I had drawn some parallels now and then i.e. 1999-2000 when Manchester United took on Real Madrid in the quarters although it was not the most recent of the clashes as they played again in 2003. But it was the 2000-01 season game that I was drawn to more.

Real then were in a similar state to now, in La Liga. Managed by Vicente Del Bosque Real were in doldrums domestically, struggling, completely out of the title race by the time the teams met. On the contrary Manchester United were flying in the premiership, falling behind conveniently and then romping home in style by hammering in goals through a mouth watering forward line of Cole, Yorke, Sheringham and Solskjaer. Does it ring a bell? There obviously are similarities between now and then. I hope you have figured out by now.

And this could well be the clash that could change the paths of the clubs again forever; As it did all those years ago. Manchester United after that defeat changed their approach dramatically, it was quite a seismic change considering the fact that they were arguably the best side in Europe at that time. And Real Madrid on the other hand went ahead and won the Champions League title by beating Valencia. And we all know how the history has panned out since then.

And As far as the City fans are concerned, I would ask them to come attend the second leg at Old Trafford , to actually learn how to win a game in Europe.

Think about this.

Till next time………………………………
