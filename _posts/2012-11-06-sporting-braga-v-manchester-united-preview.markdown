We make the trip to Braga as we face them in our fourth game of the group stages at the picturesque Estadio AXA. After having come through a rather tricky spell of games pretty much unscathed, the morale of the camp has to be high and we should be able to get at least a point from the game which would more or less confirm our progress through to the next stage.

Braga had played without fear at Old Trafford when they came visiting last month on Matchday 3, and they are expected to be a handful with their prolific scorer Eder being singled out as the danger man. This is the same team that had lead against us 2-0 at home with some fine wing play; yeah we were playing the diamond obviously, just to tell since I mentioned that we conceded goals through fine work on the wings by the opposition. But I don’t think Fergie will employ the same strategy again as they have been signs where we have played with great fluency in this new hybrid system of 4-2-3-1/4-4-1-1.

In team news, Anderson is expected to start for us after some very impressive displays against Chelsea in the League Cup and then against Arsenal after coming on as a substitute. His midfield partner is unknown, but I would personally see the calmness of Scholes being preferred here if we indeed play with a two in midfield, which I don’t expect us to for some reason. I would not be surprised if Sir Alex chose a cautious approach and went with a three in midfield or even the diamond to retain the ball in the centre of the park although the system has proved inefficient for us. It will be interesting to see the team sheet for tomorrow.

In other news, Sir Alex’s statue at the North End is expected to be unveiled on November 23rd Friday, quite a huge moment for us as we see the man being immortalized in the United folklore with this greatest of gestures.

Manchester city face Ajax at the Etihad stadium as they try to work a miracle to still be in contention for qualification from a seemingly impossible position right now. Manager Mancini who has admitted to have cheated on his beloved “City” with seven or eight other clubs in the summer, is currently miffed when being quizzed on these flings of his. Mancini’s tactics and signings have been called into question and he has been under a lot of pressure lately. To add to this the floundering Champions League campaign that could culminate at home should they not win against Ajax and it could all come apart for them. Things look pretty bleak on the blue half of Manchester right now.

Till next time………………………………………..
