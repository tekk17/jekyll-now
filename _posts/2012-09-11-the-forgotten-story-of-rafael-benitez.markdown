Rafael Benitez has been in the news recently expressing displeasure and surprise over him not being approached for the vacant managerial job at Liverpool last summer. Over quite what was he displeased about is something I dont know. Really, first things first, I am not doubting the manager's credentials here. This was the man who won La Liga during the Real Madrid - Barcelona hegemony days with Valencia. He won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, they made the final again in 2007 and won the FA Cup in between in 2006. They were during that period better than Manchester United by a mile in Europe.

Always famed for his ability to organize his teams well, tactically very astute and making the team function as a whole better than the parts, he made great careers out of Dirk Kuyt, Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres to name a few. But things are not as hunky dory as they seem at first. Atleast not to me. For me this man was the sole reason Liverpool lost the title in 2009 to Manchester United. His now infamous legendary rant of "Facts", part of Man United folklore was the beginning of the end for Liverpool's glory days under him. Benitez's frosty relationship at best with Midfield Maestro Xabi Alonso led to him being sold to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009. I can bet you now, that atleast 1 out of 3 Liverpool fan would have preferred Rafa leave rather than Xabi any given day. Gerrard even made a snide comment regarding this in a recent interview when he mentioned some of the reasons why they have been in imminent decline since then. He cited Xabi Alonso's departure as one of the big points that led them towards this decline.

Furthermore, Benitez's absolute love of control over everything at the club does not fit with the current ownership style across Europe. Owners now prefer to operate with a system that has a Director Of Football alongside the Manager to take care of the fuctioning of the team. Benitez as has been, on evidence with first at Liverpool and then at Inter shown that he fails to work with anyone who clashes with his idologies. His conflict of interest with Hicks and Gillet at Liverpool, subsequent fights with them over the complete control of the club showed a tendency that he does not always get along well with the owner of the club. This fact was further strengthened when it happened again at Inter , although the reasons for supposed disharmony may have been different.

But there are patterns here, which quite clearly reveal Benitez as a very difficult man to work with. And its quite clear this is why he has now been without a job for the best part of two years doing nothing apart from punditry on television. Now Rafa, I think you know why Liverpool were reluctant to approach you last summer.

Just two more words - "ANDY MURRAY"

I had to mention him today. Just had to. Having been part of the agonising wait through four finals spanning over 4 years, I was ecstatic and overjoyed with emotion when I saw him win his first grand slam today morning at the end of a 4hr 54 min marathon.

What a summer it has been for British Sports. Bradley Wiggins began it by winning the Le Tour De France, then came theÂ  olympics with all those success stories of Olympians who made Britain proud, later Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton did their bit by winning the final two races of the European F1 calendar. Surely it was time for Andy to round it off with a US Open Victory and with that end the 76 year long wait for Britain to see its first Grand Slam champion.

As Martin Samuel in the Daily Mail put it so beautifully, "it is not what the olympics have done for Britain but what Britain has done for the Olympics. Be proud of yourselves, you have earned it "
