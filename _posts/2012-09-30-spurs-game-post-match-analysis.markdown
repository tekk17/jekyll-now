I had this dream last night, where we did manage to equalize against Spurs in the second half and end the game at 3-3; quite a beautiful dream that was and it was only a dream. Now, coming back to the stark reality that we lost our first game at home yesterday due to a very bad performance in the first half I have to say. Words like lacking in intensity, lack of drive, passion, hunger might not be new words to readers of my blog but I cannot help myself use them again if you saw what I saw last night at the game. I can whine all I want about our pathetic and outright abject midfield display in the first half, make a huge comment on this crisis that the team is going through where we turn in one abject performance after another but quite frankly I am not going to do that today. Not one wee bit. There are bigger issues to be pointed out, while I will not be going into the tactical side of things like Michael Cox or Jonathan Wilson does I will be making quite a few points here that I have noticed over the few games, points that have been the root cause at us being dominated in midfield.

I will be speaking mainly about the performance in the first half here, because our performance in the first half itself was the sole reason why we lost the game yesterday. Coming to the midfield pairing of Carrick and Scholes, isn’t it a very very static pairing. Rarely do you see Scholesy making runs frequently in the opposition half nowadays and it is not his role to do so either. Fergie remoulded him into a deep lying playmaker in his thirties as he lost the legs to make those runs late into his career and he was magnificent in this role yesterday in the second half with some of his passes being of breathtaking brilliance[more satisfying to watch then soft porn for me, mind you!]. Now coming back to the main point, Carrick on the other hand is similar, not the very mobile, he is after all a passer and a good tactical reader of the game which he uses to good effect defensively in midfield. You get the point here, aren’t these two similar typed players. Both wanting to sit deep in the middle circle and pass the ball around. No one makes runs with ball and you would not expect it from the two to make those either. Quite why Fergie chooses to go with this pairing quite so frequently is beyond my comprehension. There is no mobility in the centre of the park at all.

But the answer lies in the formation here, we have been trying to make a switch to the 4-2-3-1 formation here where it would seem acceptable to have two static lying midfielders if you have a very fluent attacking front four. Kagawa playing in the hole behind the striker does this job for me. But he is still trying to come to terms with the game in the premiership here. He comes deep for the ball and 3 out of 5 times plays a square pass or returns the ball back to the player; this is when he comes deep and asks for the ball that we are talking about. Rarely have I seen him make a brilliant turn and charge at the opposition form deep [his goal was brilliant mind you], while we have bought him to do that and he will start doing that in time but it is here that we are lacking in our play currently. There is no runner in the midfield that could run with the ball and charge at the opposition. That’s where we are falling short, that’s why we are getting dominated.

I watched the game against Newcastle United in midweek and was impressed by the passing and running of Cleverley and Anderson in the centre of the park. It was a very interesting experiment that Fergie tried that night in a hybrid of 4-3-3 and a 4-2-3-1 where Cleverley and Anderson were freed of their defensive duties as they knew Fletcher was holding the fort for them and duly combined with some brilliant dynamic play and incisive passing to score a goal each. It is a system that we could see in the future and it will be quite an exciting one. It’s still early in the season and we still are trying to come to terms with this new system in practise here and I would urge fans to show some patience, because by striking some balance in our approach here we could be on for something beautiful in the days ahead.

Coming back, now onto the defensive side of things, this static midfield complicates things here too. We are not having a chaser of the ball, someone who would hustle and harry the opposition players, Carrick and Scholes are too slow to do that. And neither can they tackle with both basing their game on interceptions and reading the play with some typically rash tackles from Scholesy thrown in here and there. This is hurting us, even when Giggs plays [lacking in mobility this season, strangely]although he is more mobile then the other two; It is so easy to run past them and have a go right at the centre halves without breaking a sweat and that’s what Tottenham did so brilliantly yesterday; We were caught out postionally very badly high up the pitch and were thus in no position to defend and Spurs exploited that brilliantly with some pacy runs by Vertonghen, Dempsey, Bale and Defoe. We can criticise the centre halves if you want but they need some protection from the players in front of them and they got none yesterday, we were that bad, there were neither attacking patterns, nor any static defensive pattern to our play and thus we suffered. And this thing of being exposed in the midfield through pace has become a quite uneasy pattern of late. Teams have been doing this against us regularly and will adopt it again when they play against us. For me a midfield pairing from a set of Scholes, Giggs, Carrick just won’t work FULL STOP.

That’s all, True to my word I did not make any point about our midfield crisis and highlighted only the shortcoming that we are having currently and we will correct those with some defensive solidity at the back and by exercising some caution in our play and using a sensible approach. We turned up yesterday in the first half looking to rollover Tottenham without breaking a sweat and duly got a kick right up our backsides. I do hope we won’t get to see a repeat of this again. It’s time for some 1-0 victories now.

Till next time……………………………………………………………………………
