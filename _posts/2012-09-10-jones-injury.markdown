It was announced that our young centre half Phil Jones will be undergoing an knee operation this week that could sideline him for upto 6-8 weeks. Its been a very frustrating beginning for the lad this season and to be out for three months of the campaign early on will be very disappointing. A very interesting comment made by Arsene Wenger comes to my mind when he was speaking about Jack Wilshere's injury setback last year. He said that bright young players do tend to get injured during the age bracket of 19-21 years, and how stronger do they come back both mentally and physically is what defines them for the rest of their careers.

Its really disappointing to see lads as talented as Jones and WIlshere on the treatment table, but I hope that they will come back stronger. Wilshere has started training again and is expected for an October return. I for one wont be surprised if Wenger chooses to be cautious with the long awaited return of his new no.10 . It was similar for us with the Cleverley injury last year. He got injured at Bolton then made a comeback at Everton at the end of October and then suffered one setback after the other to have a very frustrating end to a campaign that promised so much in the beginning.

There are very high expectations from Jones this season after the impressive showing from last year, although he did tend to fade off a bit towards the end of the campaign. Mainly deployed at Right back, I was very excited to see him play in midfield. He gave some magnificient displays in that position for us in early winter when we went through that brilliant defensive run from late October to early December. A run that culminated with us loosing to Blackburn on New YEar's eve. Further impressive showings in midfield in England shirt only enhanced his reputation as Fabio Capello likened him to his new Baresi. I am very interested in where he will be deployed this term when he does come back in the first team fold later on. WIth enhanced experience from a campaign, I surely expect him to iron out those weaknesses that he showed last season, Mainly, his lack of reading of the game and Poor positioning inÂ  the heart of defence, even his physical presence was poor, considering he is quite a big lad and should do well in that aspect. But I expect him to comeback stronger than ever and flourish in the position that he was brought for - Heart of the defence.

Till next time................................................................
